%X Abstract. Environmental flow (E-flow) frameworks advocate holistic, regional-scale,
probabilistic E-flow assessments that consider flow and non-flow drivers of
change in a socio-ecological context as best practice. Regional-scale
ecological risk assessments of multiple stressors to social and ecological
endpoints, which address ecosystem dynamism, have been undertaken
internationally at different spatial scales using the relative-risk model
since the mid-1990s. With the recent incorporation of Bayesian belief
networks into the relative-risk model, a robust regional-scale ecological
risk assessment approach is available that can contribute to achieving the
best practice recommendations of E-flow frameworks. PROBFLO is a holistic
E-flow assessment method that incorporates the relative-risk model and
Bayesian belief networks (BN-RRM) into a transparent probabilistic modelling
tool that addresses uncertainty explicitly. PROBFLO has been developed to
evaluate the socio-ecological consequences of historical, current and future
water resource use scenarios and generate E-flow requirements on regional
spatial scales. The approach has been implemented in two regional-scale case
studies in Africa where its flexibility and functionality has been
demonstrated. In both case studies the evidence-based outcomes facilitated
informed environmental management decision making, with trade-off
considerations in the context of social and ecological aspirations. This
paper presents the PROBFLO approach as applied to the Senqu River catchment
in Lesotho and further developments and application in the Mara River
catchment in Kenya and Tanzania. The 10 BN-RRM procedural steps incorporated
in PROBFLO are demonstrated with examples from both case studies. PROBFLO can
contribute to the adaptive management of water resources and contribute to
the allocation of resources for sustainable use of resources and address
protection requirements.

%X Maritime risk research often suffers from insufficient data for accurate prediction and analysis. This paper aims to conduct a new risk analysis by incorporating the latest maritime accident data into a Bayesian network (BN) model to analyze the key risk influential factors (RIFs) in the maritime sector. It makes important contributions in terms of a novel maritime accident database, new RIFs, findings, and implications. More specifically, the latest maritime accident data from 2017 to 2021 is collected from both the Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS) and Lloyd’s Register Fairplay (LRF) databases. Based on the new dataset, 23 RIFs are identified, involving both dynamic and static risk factors. With these developments, new findings and implications are revealed beyond the state-of-the-art of maritime risk analysis. For instance, the research results show ship type, ship operation, voyage segment, deadweight, length, and power are among the most influencing factors. The new BN-based risk model offers reliable and accurate risk prediction results, evident by its prediction performance and scenario analysis. It provides valuable insights into the development of rational accident prevention mea­ sures that could well fit the increasing demands of maritime safety in today’s complex shipping environment.

%T Fault Diagnosis Methodology of Redundant Closed-Loop Feedback Control Systems: Subsea Blowout Preventer System as a Case Study
%V 53
%N 3
%P 1618-1629
%U https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9896847/
%X In closed-loop feedback control systems, faults are propagated through the feedback link, which eventually leads to the abnormality of the entire system. Generally, it is very difﬁcult to identify the faults of systems under the inﬂuence of the closed-loop feedback link. The existence of redundancy improves the reliability of the system. Meanwhile, it also poses new challenges to the fault diagnosis of multiple redundant systems. In this regard, a causality-based method is proposed for the fault diagnosis of closed-loop feedback control system with multiple modular redundancy. The dynamic Bayesian networks for fault diagnosis are established based on sensor data and system parameters. The networks consist of four layers, which are sensors, performances, monitors, and faults, respectively. Furthermore, the conditional probabilities of the fault nodes are calculated by Noisy-OR and Noisy-MAX models. The proposed method can dynamically evaluate system performance and integrate other monitoring information as evidence to assist faults diagnosis and location. A double modular redundant control system for a subsea blowout preventer is used as a case to demonstrate the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed method has high accuracy. The inﬂuence of sampling frequency, noise, and redundancy mode on diagnosis results is studied and discussed in the case study.

%P S65-S70
%U https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2019.1630827
%X Objective: In order to introduce automated vehicles on public roads, it is necessary to ensure that these vehicles are safe to operate in traffic. One challenge is to prove that all physically possible variations of situations can be handled safely within the operational design domain of the vehicle. A promising approach to handling the set of possible situations is to identify a manageable number of logical scenarios, which provide an abstraction for object properties and behavior within the situations. These can then be transferred into concrete scenarios defining all parameters necessary to reproduce the situation in different test environments.
Methods: This article proposes a framework for defining safety-relevant scenarios based on the potential collision between the subject vehicle and a challenging object, which forces the subject vehicle to depart from its planned course of action to avoid a collision. This allows defining only safety-relevant scenarios, which can directly be related to accident classification. The first criterion for defining a scenario is the area of the subject vehicle with which the object would collide. As a second criterion, 8 different positions around the subject vehicle are considered. To account for other relevant objects in the scenario, factors that influence the challenge for the subject vehicle can be added to the scenario. These are grouped as action constraints, dynamic occlusions, and causal chains.
Results: By applying the proposed systematics, a catalog of base scenarios for a vehicle traveling on controlled-access highways has been generated, which can directly be linked to parameters in accident classification. The catalog serves as a basis for scenario classification within the PEGASUS project.
Conclusions: Defining a limited number of safety-relevant scenarios helps to realize a systematic safety assurance process for automated vehicles. Scenarios are defined based on the point of the potential collision of a challenging object with the subject vehicle and its initial position. This approach allows defining scenarios for different environments and different driving states of the subject vehicle using the same mechanisms. A next step is the generation of logical scenarios for other driving states of the subject vehicle and for other traffic environments.

%T Calibrating and Comparing Autonomous Braking Systems in Motorized-to-Non-Motorized-Vehicle Conflict Scenarios
%P 1-16
%X Assuring the safety of all road users, including non-motorized vehicles, is important in the autonomous driving environment. Autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems have provided an effective way for automated vehicles to avoid collisions with the less easily detectable non-motorized vehicles. Automatic preventive braking (APB) is a new method proposed by Mobileye that promises to reduce crashes without reducing traffic throughput, but APB's effectiveness has not yet been evaluated. This study therefore calibrates and compares the performance of APB with that of one-stage and three-stage AEB braking systems in safety-critical events (SCEs) between motorized and non-motorized vehicles, using SCEs extracted from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study and simulated in MATLAB's Simulink. The evaluation results, which consider both safety and conservativeness, show that 1) one-stage AEB with a deceleration of 5.5,m/s² and a time-to-collision threshold of 1.6 seconds can prevent all SCEs from becoming crashes; 2) APB has the best driving stability but its safety performance is inferior to that of the two AEB systems; 3) APB's deceleration process is easily affected by its pre-defined parameters and changing kinetic parameters, which may be one cause of its crashes; 4) AEB's time-triggered braking process is more consistent and reliable than APB's distance-triggered process.

%T Towards an Ontology for Scenario Definition for the Assessment of Automated Vehicles: An Object-Oriented Framework
%P 1-1
%X The development of new assessment methods for the performance of automated vehicles is essential to enable the deployment of automated driving technologies, due to the complex operational domain of automated vehicles. One contributing method is scenario-based assessment in which test cases are derived from real-world road traffic scenarios obtained from driving data. Given the complexity of the reality that is being modeled in these scenarios, it is a challenge to define a structure for capturing these scenarios. An intensional definition that provides a set of characteristics that are deemed to be both necessary and sufficient to qualify as a scenario assures that the scenarios constructed are both complete and intercomparable. In this article, we develop a comprehensive and operable definition of the notion of scenario while considering existing definitions in the literature. This is achieved by proposing an object-oriented framework in which scenarios and their building blocks are defined as classes of objects having attributes, methods, and relationships with other objects. The object-oriented approach promotes clarity, modularity, reusability, and encapsulation of the objects. We provide definitions and justifications of each of the terms. Furthermore, the framework is used to translate the terms in a coding language that is publicly available.

%T Formal Certification Methods for Automated Vehicle Safety Assessment
%P 1-1
%X Challenges related to automated driving are no longer focused on just the construction of such automated vehicles (AVs) but also on assuring the safety of operation. Recent advances in Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving have motivated more extensive study in safety guarantees of complicated AV maneuvers, which aligns with the goal of ISO 21448 (Safety of the Intended Functions or SOTIF), i.e., minimizing unsafe scenarios both known and unknown, as well as Vision Zero – eliminating highway fatalities by 2050. A majority of approaches used in providing safety guarantees for AV motion control originate from formal methods, especially reachability analysis (RA), which relies on mathematical models for the dynamic evolution of the system to provide guarantees. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no review papers dedicated to describing and interpreting state-of-the-art of formal methods in the context of AVs. In this work, we provide both an overview of the safety verification, validation, and certification process, as well as a review of formal safety techniques that are best suited to AV applications. We also propose a unified scenario coverage framework that can provide either a formal or sample-based estimate of safety verification for full AVs. Finally, challenges and future opportunities beyond the scope of current published research for assured AV safety are presented.

%T Incorporating safety relevance and realistic parameter combinations in test-case generation for automated driving safety assessment
%P 1-6
%X This research contextualizes within ongoing international efforts to harmonize a standardized methodology to evaluate automated driving systems' safety. Most methodologies currently under development generate test-cases by applying combinatory or stochastic approaches to scenario-specific vehicle kinematics parameter distributions extracted from naturalistic driving data. This implies that safety relevance and parameter correlations may not always be properly accounted for in generating the test-cases, and that the methodology itself becomes dependent on a reference safety model that needs to be agreed upon. Therefore, the specific aim of this paper is to develop a methodology that incorporates parameter correlations and accounts for safety relevance in the process to generate test-cases for automated driving systems safety evaluation, and that does not depend on reference models. First, we show the importance of incorporating parameter correlations within a given scenario, and propose a methodology to calculate linear dependencies in safety relevant situations. Second, we propose a methodology to generate test-cases that accounts for the previous correlation analysis results. In order to study the feasibility of the methodology proposed, we apply it to a set of cut-in maneuvers processed from naturalistic highway driving data previously collected in Germany. The developed methodology informs currently ongoing discussions on a possible way to approach test-case generation within the automated driving safety evaluation process.

%T Generation of tests for safety assessment of V2V platooning trucks
%C Hamburg
%U https://zenodo.org/record/5040362
%X Large steps are being taken by the industry and R&D organizations in automated driving technology development, as well as in setting up appropriate methods for safety assessment of cooperative automated driving functions. An important component of safety assessment is scenario based testing. I n this paper, we will focus on the generation of scenario based tests for a very specific group of vehicles: trucks in a platoon enabled by vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication. The basis is formed by previously proposed scenario based assessment methods for individual automated driving vehicles. These methods however do not consider the inter vehicle communication component. It is discussed how V2V communication interconnects vehicles in a system of systems, and how to include V2V communication in the scenario description. By means of practical application , it is shown how V2V communication influences the description of tests for the individual trucks in a platoon , to make assessment of safe deployment of multi brand platoons on the public road possible .

%T Evaluation Framework for Performance Limitation of Autonomous Systems under Sensor Attack
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07118
%X Autonomous systems such as self-driving cars rely on sensors to perceive the surrounding world. Measures must be taken against attacks on sensors, which have been a hot topic in the last few years. For that goal one must ﬁrst evaluate how sensor attacks aﬀect the system, i.e. which part or whole of the system will fail if some of the built-in sensors are compromised, or will keep safe, etc. Among the relevant safety standards, ISO/PAS 21448 addresses the safety of road vehicles taking into account the performance limitations of sensors, but leaves security aspects out of scope. On the other hand, ISO/SAE 21434 addresses the security perspective during the development process of vehicular systems, but not speciﬁc threats such as sensor attacks. As a result the safety of autonomous systems under sensor attack is yet to be addressed. In this paper we propose a framework that combines safety analysis for scenario identiﬁcation, and scenario-based simulation with sensor attack models embedded. Given an autonomous system model, we identify hazard scenarios caused by sensor attacks, and evaluate the performance limitations in the scenarios. We report on a prototype simulator for autonomous vehicles with radar, cameras and LiDAR along with attack models against the sensors. Our experiments show that our framework can evaluate how the system safety changes as parameters of the attacks and the sensors vary.

%X For 1 ≤ m ≤ n, we consider a natural m-out-of-n multiinstance scenario for a public-key encryption (PKE) scheme. An adversary, given n independent instances of PKE, wins if he breaks at least m out of the n instances. In this work, we are interested in the scaling factor of PKE schemes, SF, which measures how well the diﬃculty of breaking m out of the n instances scales in m. That is, a scaling factor SF = indicates that breaking m out of n instances is at least times more diﬃcult than breaking one single instance. A PKE scheme with small scaling factor hence provides an ideal target for mass surveillance. In fact, the Logjam attack (CCS 2015) implicitly exploited, among other things, an almost constant scaling factor of ElGamal over ﬁnite ﬁelds (with shared group parameters).

%X Though existential unforgeability under adaptively chosenmessage attacks is well-accepted for the security of digital signature schemes, the security against key substitution attacks is also of interest, and has been considered for several practical digital signature schemes such as DSA and ECDSA. In this paper, we consider generalized key substitution attacks where the base element is considered as a part of the public key and can be substituted. We ﬁrst show that the general framework of certiﬁcate-based signature schemes deﬁned in ISO/IEC 14888-3 is vulnerable to a generalized key substitution attack. We then prove that the Chinese standard SM2 signature scheme is existentially unforgeable against adaptively chosen-message attacks in the generic group model if the underlying hash function h is uniform and collision-resistant and the underlying conversion function f is almost-invertible, and the SM2 digital signature scheme is secure against the generalized key substitution attacks if the underlying hash functions H and h are modeled as non-programmable random oracles (NPROs).

%X We revisit the SM2 protocol, which is widely used in Chinese commercial applications and by Chinese government agencies. Although it is by now standard practice for protocol designers to provide security proofs in widely accepted security models in order to assure protocol implementers of their security properties, the SM2 protocol does not have a proof of security. In this paper, we prove the security of the SM2 protocol in the widely accepted indistinguishability-based Bellare-Rogaway model under the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) assumption. We also present a simplified and more efficient version of the SM2 protocol with an accompanying security proof.

%X The Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transformation (CRYPTO 1999 and Journal of Cryptology 2013) turns any weakly secure public-key encryption scheme into a strongly (i.e., IND-CCA) secure one in the random oracle model. Unfortunately, the FO analysis suﬀers from several drawbacks, such as a non-tight security reduction, and the need for a perfectly correct scheme. While several alternatives to the FO transformation have been proposed, they have stronger requirements, or do not obtain all desired properties.

%X Since the appearance of public-key cryptography in the seminal DiﬃeHellman paper, many new schemes have been proposed and many have been broken. Thus, the simple fact that a cryptographic algorithm withstands cryptanalytic attacks for several years is often considered as a kind of validation procedure. A much more convincing line of research has tried to provide “provable” security for cryptographic protocols. Unfortunately, in many cases, provable security is at the cost of a considerable loss in terms of eﬃciency. Another way to achieve some kind of provable security is to identify concrete cryptographic objects such as hash functions with ideal random objects and to use arguments from relativized complexity theory. The model underlying this approach is often called the “random oracle model.” We use the word “arguments” for security results proved in this model. As usual, these arguments are relative to wellestablished hard algorithmic problems such as factorization or the discrete logarithm.

%X Proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols are emerging as one of the most promising alternative to the wasteful proof-of-work (PoW) protocols for consensus in Blockchains (or distributed ledgers). However, current PoS protocols inherently disclose both the identity and the wealth of the stakeholders, and thus seem incompatible with privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies (such as ZCash, Monero, etc.). In this paper we initiate the formal study for PoS protocols with privacy properties. Our results include: 1. A (theoretical) feasibility result showing that it is possible to construct a general class of private PoS (PPoS) protocols; and to add privacy to a wide class of PoS protocols, 2. A privacy-preserving version of a popular PoS protocol, Ouroboros Praos. Towards our result, we deﬁne the notion of anonymous veriﬁable random function, which we believe is of independent interest.

%X Identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) is an eﬀective method to protect the data security and privacy in multi-receiver scenarios, which can make broadcast encryption more practical. This paper further expands the study of scalable revocation methodology in the setting of IBBE, where a key authority releases a key update material periodically in such a way that only non-revoked users can update their decryption keys. Following the binary tree data structure approach, a concrete instantiation of revocable IBBE scheme is proposed using asymmetric pairings of prime order bilinear groups. Moreover, this scheme can withstand decryption key exposure, which is proven to be semi-adaptively secure under chosen plaintext attacks in the standard model by reduction to static complexity assumptions. In particular, the proposed scheme is very eﬃcient both in terms of computation costs and communication bandwidth, as the ciphertext size is constant, regardless of the number of recipients. To demonstrate the practicality, it is further implemented in Charm, a framework for rapid prototyping of cryptographic primitives.

%X In this paper, we introduce a distributed key generation (DKG) protocol with aggregatable and publicly-veriﬁable transcripts. Compared with prior publicly-veriﬁable approaches, our DKG reduces the size of the ﬁnal transcript and the time to verify it from O(n2) to O(n log n), where n denotes the number of parties. As compared with prior non-publicly-veriﬁable approaches, our DKG leverages gossip rather than all-to-all communication to reduce veriﬁcation and communication complexity. We also revisit existing DKG security deﬁnitions, which are quite strong, and propose new and natural relaxations. As a result, we can prove the security of our aggregatable DKG as well as that of several existing DKGs, including the popular Pedersen variant. We show that, under these new deﬁnitions, these existing DKGs can be used to yield secure threshold variants of popular cryptosystems such as El-Gamal encryption and BLS signatures. We also prove that our DKG can be securely combined with a new eﬃcient veriﬁable unpredictable function (VUF), whose security we prove in the random oracle model. Finally, we experimentally evaluate our DKG and show that the perparty overheads scale linearly and are practical. For 64 parties, it takes 71 ms to share and 359 ms to verify the overall transcript, while for 8192 parties, it takes 8 s and 42.2 s respectively.

%X There is a huge gap between the upper and lower bounds on the share size of secret-sharing schemes for arbitrary n-party access structures, and consistent with our current knowledge the optimal share size can be anywhere between polynomial in n and exponential in n. For linear secret-sharing schemes, we know that the share size for almost all n-party access structures must be exponential in n. Furthermore, most constructions of eﬃcient secret-sharing schemes are linear. We would like to study larger classes of secret-sharing schemes with two goals. On one hand, we want to prove lower bounds for larger classes of secretsharing schemes, possibly shedding some light on the share size of general secret-sharing schemes. On the other hand, we want to construct eﬃcient secret-sharing schemes for access structures that do not have eﬃcient linear secret-sharing schemes. Given this motivation, Paskin-Cherniavsky and Radune (ITC’20) deﬁned and studied a new class of secret-sharing schemes in which the shares are generated by applying degree-d polynomials to the secret and some random ﬁeld elements. The special case d = 1 corresponds to linear and multi-linear secret-sharing schemes.

%X Non-interactive key exchange (NIKE) is a fundamental but much-overlooked cryptographic primitive. It appears as a major contribution in the ground-breaking paper of Diﬃe and Hellman, but NIKE has remained largely unstudied since then. In this paper, we provide diﬀerent security models for this primitive and explore the relationships between them. We then give constructions for secure NIKE in the Random Oracle Model based on the hardness of factoring and in the standard model based on the hardness of a variant of the decisional Bilinear Diﬃe Hellman Problem for asymmetric pairings. We also study the relationship between NIKE and public key encryption (PKE), showing that a secure NIKE scheme can be generically converted into an IND-CCA secure PKE scheme. Our conversion also illustrates the fundamental nature of NIKE in public key cryptography.

%X A multi-signature scheme enables a group of signers to produce a compact, joint signature on a common document, and has many potential uses. However, existing schemes impose key setup or PKI requirements that make them impractical, such as requiring a dedicated, distributed key generation protocol amongst potential signers, or assuming strong, concurrent zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of secret keys done to the CA at key registration. These requirements limit the use of the schemes. We provide a new scheme that is proven secure in the plain public-key model, meaning requires nothing more than that each signer has a (certiﬁed) public key. Furthermore, the important simpliﬁcation in key management achieved is not at the cost of eﬃciency or assurance: our scheme matches or surpasses known ones in terms of signing time, veriﬁcation time and signature size, and is proven secure in the random-oracle model under a standard (not bilinear map related) assumption. The proof is based on a simpliﬁed and general Forking Lemma that may be of independent interest.

%T Adversarial Evaluation of Autonomous Vehicles in Lane-Change Scenarios
%P 1-10
%U https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9468363/
%X Autonomous vehicles must be comprehensively evaluated before deployed in cities and highways. However, most existing evaluation approaches for autonomous vehicles are static and lack adaptability, so they are usually inefﬁcient in generating challenging scenarios for tested vehicles. In this paper, we propose an adaptive evaluation framework to efﬁciently evaluate autonomous vehicles in adversarial environments generated by deep reinforcement learning. Considering the multimodal nature of dangerous scenarios, we use ensemble models to represent different local optimums for diversity. We then utilize a nonparametric Bayesian method to cluster the adversarial policies. The proposed method is validated in a typical lane-change scenario that involves frequent interactions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding vehicles. Results show that the adversarial scenarios generated by our method signiﬁcantly degrade the performance of the tested vehicles. We also illustrate different patterns of generated adversarial environments, which can be used to infer the weaknesses of the tested vehicles.

%X With the advent of technologies that allow for selfdriving and autonomous vehicles, it is of the utmost importance to ensure the safety of occupants, pedestrians, and other motorists. Investigating when, why, and how these vehicles fail is integral to preventing future recurrences of these kinds of incidents. By gathering these accidents, their associated data, and simulating them, it is possible to identify the major reasons for the accident as well as allowing for the testing and veriﬁcation of autonomous vehicles (AVs), before they encounter the real world. This knowledge can then be further reﬁned for the purposes of establishing a set of standards for AV safety and capabilities. This paper proposes a novel system for crash scenario generation which works based on actual AV crashes. In addition, there does not yet exist a cloud based database for housing AV crashes, locations, and descriptions. Furthermore, there also does not exist an automated system that creates simulated testing scenarios based on real AV crashes. Our proposed algorithm checks the AV crash location and designs virtual roads from map data about the crash location, retrieved from Open Street Maps. Then it is planned to use natural language processing (NLP) to generate the crash scenario based on the crash description. The virtual scenario, which includes real features of roads –such as curvature, number of lanes, and speed limits – will be used to test AVs. Another portion of the proposed system will allow for important features to be extracted automatically from these crashes, which will be used for improving the road designs capable of addressing AV’s needs.

%T Generation of Autonomous Vehicle Validation Scenarios Using Crash Data
%P 6
%X Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is expected to make a transformative impact on mobility. As a step towards that direction, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and semiautonomous features have been increasingly deployed in modern vehicles. Consequently, there have been crashes reported for these vehicles while operating in autonomous mode. In this paper, we describe a methodology to use the information from these crashes for the validation of autonomous vehicles, which is the most critical obstacle in their mass deployment. We use existing crash databases and provide a methodology to automatically convert them into test scenarios in simulation, using our scenario generation framework. The methodology assists in validation by recreating crashes and their cousin scenarios. It is also instrumental in forming the requirements the accident reports for autonomous vehicles.

However, the autonomous vehicles must be proven to be at least as safe as human-driven vehicles before they are accepted as a new mode of transportation. Current methods of autonomous vehicle veriﬁcation such as shadow driving or annotated images based testing are costly, slow and resource intensive. Hence, modeling and simulation is an indispensable asset to achieve veriﬁcation goals for autonomous vehicles.

This paper presents a digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system (MCPS) for parallel controlling of smart workshop under mass individualization paradigm. By establishing cyberphysical connection via decentralized digital twin models, various manufacturing resources can be formed as dynamic autonomous system to co-create personalized products. Clarification on the MCPS concept, characteristics, architecture, configuration, operating mechanism and key enabling technologies are elaborated, respectively. A demonstrative implementation of the digital twin-driven parallel controlling of board-type product smart manufacturing workshop is also presented.

%T ManuChain: Combining Permissioned Blockchain With a Holistic Optimization Model as Bi-Level Intelligence for Smart Manufacturing
%P 1-11
%U 10.1109/TSMC.2019.2930418
%X The growth of individualized product demands drives high ﬂexibility of manufacturing processes, which requires large-scale deployment of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Since centralized control of IIoT suffers from poor ﬂexibility in coping with disturbances and changes, a decentralized organization structure is a better choice, in which a permissioned blockchain-driven IIoT can enable partially decentralized selforganization and thus ofﬂoad and accelerate the optimization of upper-level manufacturing planning. A novel iterative bi-level hybrid intelligence model named ManuChain is proposed to get rid of unbalance/inconsistency between holistic planning and local execution in individualized manufacturing systems. Lowerlevel blockchain-driven smart contracts proactively decentralize ﬁne-grained and individualized task execution among machine tools via Raspberry Pi-based smart gateways and make the results available on an upper-level digital twin model for iterative coarse-grained holistic optimization.

%X Digital twin (DT) is one of the most promising enabling technologies for realizing smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0. DTs are characterized by the seamless integration between the cyber and physical spaces. The importance of DTs is increasingly recognized by both academia and industry. It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other ﬁelds. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry. This paper also outlines the current challenges and some possible directions for future work.

%X Technological advancements of urban informatics and vehicular intelligence have enabled connected smart vehicles as pervasive edge computing platforms for a plethora of powerful applications. However, varies types of smart vehicles with distinct capacities, diverse applications with different resource demands as well as unpredictive vehicular topology, pose signiﬁcant challenges on realizing efﬁcient edge computing services. To cope with these challenges, we incorporate digital twin technology and artiﬁcial intelligence into the design of a vehicular edge computing network. It centrally exploits potential edge service matching through evaluating cooperation gains in a mirrored edge computing system, while distributively scheduling computation task ofﬂoading and edge resource allocation in an multiagent deep reinforcement learning approach. We further propose a coordination graph driven vehicular task ofﬂoading scheme, which minimizes ofﬂoading costs through efﬁciently integrating service matching exploitation and intelligent ofﬂoading scheduling in both digital twin and physical networks. Numerical results based on real urban trafﬁc data-sets demonstrate the efﬁciency of our proposed schemes.

This information can be used by a lane assistant agent within driver assistance systems. This work adopted an egocentric viewpoint for the vision and the reasoning tasks of the vehicle and a qualitative approach to spatial representation. Results with real data indicate good performance compared to the common sense interpretation of traﬃc situations.

%X Automated Driving Systems (ADS) require extensive evaluation to assure acceptable levels of safety before they can operate in real-world trafﬁc. Although many tools are available to perform such tests in simulation, the lack of a language to formally capture test scenarios that cover the complexity of road trafﬁc situations hinders the reproducibility of tests and impairs the exchangeability between tools. We propose GeoScenario as a Domain-Speciﬁc Language (DSL) for scenario representation to substantiate test cases in simulation. By adopting GeoScenario in the simulation infrastructure of a self-driving car project, we use the language in practice to test an autonomy stack in simulation. The language was built on top of the well-known Open Street Map standard, and designed to be simple and extensible.

%X The latest version of the ISO 26262 standard from 2016 represents the state of the art for a safety-guided development of safety-critical electric/electronic vehicle systems. These vehicle systems include advanced driver assistance systems and vehicle guidance systems. The development process proposed in the ISO 26262 standard is based upon multiple V-models, and deﬁnes activities and work products for each process step. In many of these process steps, scenario based approaches can be applied to achieve the deﬁned work products for the development of automated driving functions. To accomplish the work products of different process steps, scenarios have to focus on various aspects like a human understandable notation or a description via state variables. This leads to contradictory requirements regarding the level of detail and way of notation for the representation of scenarios. In this paper, the authors discuss requirements for the representation of scenarios in different process steps deﬁned by the ISO 26262 standard, propose a consistent terminology based on prior publications for the identiﬁed levels of abstraction, and demonstrate how scenarios can be systematically evolved along the phases of the development process outlined in the ISO 26262 standard.

%X Scenario-based development and test processes are a promising approach for verifying and validating automated driving functions. For this purpose, scenarios have to be generated during the development process in a traceable manner. In early development stages, the operating scenarios of the item to be developed are usually described in an abstract, linguistic way. Within the scope of a simulation-assisted test process, these linguistically described scenarios have to be transformed into a state space representation and converted into data formats which can be used with the respective simulation environment. Currently, this step of detailing scenarios takes a considerable manual effort. Furthermore, a standardized interpretation of the linguistically described scenarios and a consistent transformation into the data formats are not guaranteed due to multiple authors as well as many constraints between the scenario parameters. In this paper, the authors present an approach to automatically detail a keyword-based scenario description for execution in a simulation environment and provide a basis for test case generation. As a ﬁrst step, the keyword-based description is transformed into a parameter space representation. At the same time, constraints regarding the selection and combination of parameter values are documented for the following process steps (e. g. evolutionary or stochastic test methods). As a second step, the parameter space representation is converted into data formats required by the simulation environment. As an example, the authors use scenarios on German freeways and convert them into the data formats OpenDRIVE (description of the road) and OpenSCENARIO (description of trafﬁc participants and environmental conditions) for execution in the simulation environment Virtual Test Drive.

%X Take-over process refers to the situation where drivers are required to take over control of vehicles under certain conditions, which currently lacks safety analysis. To address this problem, Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is extended according to ISO 21448 for the safety analysis of a take-over system, which consists of a driver and a human-machine interface (HMI). First, system-level hazards are analyzed to develop safety constraints. Then, a control structure of the take-over process is modeled to identify unsafe control actions considering human factors. Finally, causal factors of the unsafe control actions are analyzed, and safety requirements regarding HMI are put forward to guide the design of the take-over system. This method was applied to analyze the take-over system of an autonomous vehicle operating in a closed area, and corresponding safety requirements were determined. Based on the results of a questionnaire survey and a take-over test, the analysis method is proved to be applicable to improving the safety of the take-over system.

%X To provide overall safety to the automotive domain both vehicle safety and security need to be considered. Cybersecurity is a key to define the quality of the autonomous vehicle by introducing safe and secure development and risk assessment. The implementation of the Over-The-Air (OTA) updates in the automotive industry brought many facilities to the drier and the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The amount of cost-saving from OTA for OEMs is assumed over several billion. So, research is essential for safe and secure OTA updates in the autonomous vehicle. However, Highly Automated Driving Functions (HADFs) have already raised the necessity of secure development because a threat can lead to harm in certain scenarios including the functional insufficiencies as mentioned in Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF) of the system. Scenario-based Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) is extensively used in automated vehicle systems and can support for further development of scenario-based threat analysis for OTA updates. Additionally, the scenario-based analysis represents the alliance of safety and security during product development. Therefore, this paper illustrates the scenario-based analysis and assessment of threats including the OTA feature. Furthermore, demonstrates the processes step-by-step to perform Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) against potential vulnerabilities to obtain a set of cybersecurity goals for a HADF.

%X Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology has the potential to fundamentally transform the automotive industry, reorient transportation infrastructure, and significantly impact the energy sector. Rapid progress is being made in the core artificial intelligence engines that form the basis of AV technology. However, without a quantum leap in testing and verification, the full capabilities of AV technology will not be realized. Critical issues include finding and testing complex functional scenarios, verifying that sensor and object recognition systems accurately detect the external environment independent of weather conditions, and building a regulatory regime that enables accumulative learning. The significant contribution of this article is to outline a novel methodology for solving these issues by using the Florida Poly AV Verification Framework (FLPolyVF).

%X The increasing complexity of the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is making more diﬃcult to perform the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA). These items require high-performance Electronic Control Units (ECU) with extensive software functionalities. To correctly operate they interact with the driver, environment and other vehicle functions through high-speed in-vehicle networks, as well as a wide range of sensors and actuators. As a result, they implement complex behaviors whose outcome in presence of faults is not trivial to identify and classify as requested by the concept phase included in the most recent functional safety standards. In this paper we present a simulation-based methodology to perform the HARA of a vehicle function by mixing the usual industrial approach, based on the designers' knowledge, with one that makes use of a vehicle-level simulator. The simulation-based approach provides an automatic and systematic method to assess the complex interaction of the item under analysis with other vehicle functions in possibly complex operational situations, thus making the prediction of hazards easier. We choose to demonstrate the approach by applying it to a well-known automotive industry case study: an Advanced Emergency Braking System (AEBS). In this way, it is possible to analyze the eﬀects of the function provided by the item, keeping into account the simulations results and comparing them to similar situations analysis available in literature. Thanks to the obtained simulation-based results, safety engineers can formulate a more objective hypothesis, in particular during the hazard classiﬁcation subphase.

%X Safety and Security are two seemingly contradictory system features, which have challenged researchers for decades. Traditionally, these two features have been treated separately, but due to the increasing knowledge about their mutual impacts, similarities, and interdisciplinary values,they have become more important. Because systems (such as Car2x in the automotive industry) are increasingly interlaced, it is no longer acceptable to assume that safety systems are immune to security risks. Future automotive systems will require appropriate systematic approaches that will support security-aware safety development. Therefore, this paper presents a combined approach of the automotive HARA (hazard analysis and risk assessment) approach with the security domain STRIDE approach, and outlines the impacts of security issues on safety concepts at system level. We present an approach to classify the probability of security threats, which can be used to determine the appropriate number of countermeasures that need to be considered. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of these security threats on the safety analysis of automotive systems. This paper additionally describes how such a method has been developed based on the HARA approach, and how the safety-critical contributions of successful security attacks can be quantiﬁed and processed.

%X The 2011 release of the ﬁrst version of the ISO 26262 standard for automotive systems demand the elicitation of safety goals following a rigorous method for hazard and risk analysis. Companies are struggling with the adoption of the standard due to ambiguities, documentation demands and the alignment of the standards demands to existing processes. We previously proposed a structured engineering method to deal with these problems developed in applying action research together with an OEM. In this work, we evaluate how applicable the method is for junior automotive software engineers by a descriptive study. We provided the method to 8 members of the master course Automotive Software Engineering (ASE) at the Technical University Munich. The participants have each been working in the automotive industry for 1–4 years in parallel to their studies. We investigated their application of our method to an electronic steering column lock system. The participants applied our method in a ﬁrst round alone and afterwards discussed their results in groups. Our data analysis revealed that the participants could apply the method successfully and the hazard analysis and risk assessment achieved a high precision and productivity. Moreover, the precision could be improved signiﬁcantly during group discussions.

%X Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) in various domains like automotive, aviation, and process industry suffers from the issues of validity and reliability. While there has been an increasing appreciation of this subject, there have been limited approaches to overcome these issues. In the automotive domain, HARA is inﬂuenced by the ISO 26262 international standard which details functional safety of road vehicles. While ISO 26262 was a major step towards analysing hazards and risks, like other domains, it is also plagued by the issues of reliability. In this paper, the authors discuss the automotive HARA process. While exposing the reliability challenges of the HARA process detailed by the standard, the authors present an approach to overcome the reliability issues. The approach is obtained by creating a rule-set for automotive HARA to determine the Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) by parametrizing the individual components of an automotive HARA, i.e., severity, exposure and controllability. The initial rule-set was put to test by conducting a workshop involving international functional safety experts as participants in an experiment where rules were provided for severity and controllability ratings. Based on the qualitative results of the experiments, the rule-set was re-calibrated. The proposed HARA approach by the creation of a rule-set demonstrated reduction in variation. However, the caveat lies in the fact that the rule-set needs to be exhaustive or sufﬁciently explained in order to avoid any degree of subjective interpretation which is a source of variation and unreliability.

In this paper, we present a structured and model-based hazard analysis and risk assessment method for automotive systems. The hazard analysis and risk assessment are based on a requirements engineering process using problem frames. Their elements are represented by a UML notation extended with stereotypes. The UML model enables a rigorous validation of several constraints expressed in OCL. We illustrate our method using an electronic steering column lock system.

%X One of the major challenges of automated driving systems (ADS) is showing that they drive safely. Key to ensuring safety is eliciting a complete set of top-level safety requirements (safety goals). This is typically done with an activity called hazard analysis and risk assessment (HARA). In this paper we argue that the HARA of ISO 26262:2018 is not directly suitable for an ADS, both because the number of relevant operational situations may be vast, and because the ability of the ADS to make decisions in order to reduce risks will affect the analysis of exposure and hazards. Instead we propose a tailoring using a quantitative risk norm (QRN) with consequence classes, where each class has a limit for the frequency within which the consequences may occur. Incident types are then deﬁned and assigned to the consequence classes; the requirements prescribing the limits of these incident types are used as safety goals to fulﬁl in the implementation. The main beneﬁts of the QRN approach are the ability to show completeness of safety goals, and make sure that the safety strategy is not limited by safety goals which are not formulated in a way suitable for an ADS.

In this paper, a method of functional safety validation test of AEBS based on fault injection is studied, including the preparation, execution and passing standards of the test. This test method can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the security mechanism and is suitable for functional security validation test.

However, the autonomous vehicles must be proven to be at least as safe as human-driven vehicles before they are accepted as a new mode of transportation. Current methods of autonomous vehicle veriﬁcation such as shadow driving or annotated images based testing are costly, slow and resource intensive. Hence, modeling and simulation is an indispensable asset to achieve veriﬁcation goals for autonomous vehicles.

%X The dynamic environment due to traffic mobility and wireless communication from/to vehicles make identity authentication and trust management for privacy preservation based on vehicular edge computing (VEC) an increasingly important problem in vehicular networks. However, existing authentication schemes mainly focus on communication between a single trusted edge computing node and multiple vehicles. This framework may suffer the bottleneck problem due to the single edge computing node, and the performance depends heavily on its resources. In this paper, a blockchain empowered group-authentication scheme is proposed for vehicles with decentralized identification based on secret sharing and dynamic proxy mechanism. Sub-authentication results are aggregated for trust management based blockchain to implement collaborative authentication. The edge computing node with a higher-reputation stored in the tamper-proof blockchain can upload the final aggregated authentication result to the central server to achieve the decentralized authentication. This work analyzes typical attacks for this scheme and shows that the proposed scheme achieves cooperative privacy preservation for vehicles while also reducing communication overhead and computation cost.

%T Digital Twin Real-Time FPGA Implementation for Light Electric Vehicle Propulsion System Using EMR Organization

%X The paper focuses on implementation of several different concepts of wise analysis of light electric vehicle propulsion unit testing facility. Firstly, the concept of “digital twin” that represents a simulated replica of a complete testing facility is presented. More, instead of using an off-line simulation environment, the digital twin (DT) is programmed to run using two field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), hence it becomes an online real-time simulation. The second concept is the distribution of the digital twin. The actual unit controller is programed into one FPGA and the machine under test, its load and the power inverter are implemented into a second FPGA. The communication between the two is handled using analog and digital lines, just like the controller would be connected to the real test-bench. The third concept involves the organization of each of the two FPGA programs, based on Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) that facilitates transparency, ease of implementation and minimizes the error in coding the actual test-bench replica and then its controller. Combining all the above mentioned concept into one single lucrative tool, experimentally validated by actual measurements, proves that the concept of using a DT implemented in real-time, without doubt can be used for testing prototypes and their controls regardless of the actual test-bench. Hence, on one hand it is eco-friendly, precise and save testing method and on the other hand, the same DT can be used by researchers and testers in facilities that do not have a test-bench at their disposal.

%X Digital twin, an emerging representation of cyberphysical systems, has attracted increasing attentions very recently. It opens the way to real-time monitoring and synchronization of real-world activities with the virtual counterparts. In this study, we develop a digital twin paradigm using an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) for connected vehicles. By leveraging vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) communication, on-board devices can upload the data to the server through cellular network. The server creates a virtual world based on the received data, processes them with the proposed models, and sends them back to the connected vehicles. Drivers can beneﬁt from this V2C based ADAS, even if all computations are conducted on the cloud. The cooperative ramp merging case study is conducted, and the ﬁeld implementation results show the proposed digital twin framework can beneﬁt the transportation systems regarding mobility and environmental sustainability with acceptable communication delays and packet losses.

%X Safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) is expected to be the third type of road vehicle auto-driving safety in addition to information security and functional safety. SOTIF which is unknown and uncertain is caused by non-system failure or personnel misoperation. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that SOTIF cannot be accepted will be dangerous. The unknown triggering events triggered suddenly or exploited by a malicious hacker will pose a threat to vehicle safety. In the field of traditional network security, there have been many pieces of research on vulnerability assessment. This paper establishes hazard graph for SOTIF and triggering event models and proposes a safety assessment method for unknown triggering events of SOTIF and a method to enhances SOTIF inspired by the zero-day vulnerability assessment in the traditional cybersecurity field. The AEB system is used as an example to apply the proposed algorithm, and Petri net accessibility testing is used as a verification of the correctness of the algorithm in this paper.

%X Many machine learning applications use latent variable models to explain structure in data, whereby visible variables (= coordinates of the given datapoint) are explained as a probabilistic function of some hidden variables. Finding parameters with the maximum likelihood is NP-hard even in very simple settings. In recent years, provably e cient algorithms were nevertheless developed for models with linear structures: topic models, mixture models, hidden markov models, etc. These algorithms use matrix or tensor decomposition, and make some reasonable assumptions about the parameters of the underlying model. But matrix or tensor decomposition seems of little use when the latent variable model has nonlinearities. The current paper shows how to make progress: tensor decomposition is applied for learning the single-layer noisy or network, which is a textbook example of a Bayes net, and used for example in the classic QMR-DT software for diagnosing which disease(s) a patient may have by observing the symptoms he/she exhibits.

%X Automatic diagnosing lung cancer from computed tomography scans involves two steps: detect all suspicious lesions (pulmonary nodules) and evaluate the whole-lung/pulmonary malignancy. Currently, there are many studies about the first step, but few about the second step. Since the existence of nodule does not definitely indicate cancer, and the morphology of nodule has a complicated relationship with cancer, the diagnosis of lung cancer demands careful investigations on every suspicious nodule and integration of information of all nodules. We propose a 3-D deep neural network to solve this problem. The model consists of two modules. The first one is a 3-D region proposal network for nodule detection, which outputs all suspicious nodules for a subject. The second one selects the top five nodules based on the detection confidence, evaluates their cancer probabilities, and combines them with a leaky noisy-OR gate to obtain the probability of lung cancer for the subject. The two modules share the same backbone network, a modified U-net. The overfitting caused by the shortage of the training data is alleviated by training the two modules alternately. The proposed model won the first place in the Data Science Bowl 2017 competition.

%X The ISO/PAS 21448 [1] Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) specification was published in January 2019. The specification gives the reader a good overview of some of the challenges that designers of semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles will face. One of the key definitions in the specification is reasonably foreseeable misuse, which is very much a consideration for usability or human factors engineering. Annex E of ISO/PAS 21448 introduces over 3 pages some of the basic concepts of usability engineering, however usability engineering is a large and complex subject that requires a greater emphasis in the paper particularly on the types of methods that could ideally be utilized and also the stages in the SOTIF life-cycle where these techniques could be applied. In this paper we look at usability processes and where and how they could be enhanced in the SOTIF specification to help guide design teams and engineers through the vehicle development process. As usability engineering is such a large subject field it is only possible to give a brief overview in this paper.The terms human factors and usability are interchangeable in this paper usability is used throughout.

%X Mit der Sicherheit der Sollfunktion wird bereits frühzeitig das Konzept einer Automatisierungsfunktion für Kraftfahrzeuge systematisch auf mögliche Schwachpunkte untersucht. Dies wird zukünftig immer wichtiger, da der Fahrer zunehmend von der Fahraufgabe entlastet wird und technische Systeme immer mehr Aspekte der Fahraufgabe übernehmen. In diesem Zusammenhang steigen die Anforderungen an die Korrektheit der Automatisierungsfunktion, da der Fahrer sich bei höheren Automatisierungsgraden zunehmend auch Nebenaufgaben widmen kann und absehbar nicht mehr als performante Rückfallebene zur Verfügung steht. In diesem Kapitel wird gezeigt, dass SOTIF darauf zielt, unbekannte kritische Systemzustände frühzeitig zu offenbaren und diese einer strukturierten Gefährdungsbeherrschung zuzuführen.

%X Vorgehensmodelle stellen eine strukturierte Abfolge verschiedener Entwurfsaktivitäten dar. Auch die Sicherheit der Sollfunktion wird bewusst ingenieurmäßig gestaltet. Dieses Kapitel stellt dar, wie die Spezifikation der sicheren Sollfunktion mit dem spezifizierenden Ast des Vorgehensmodells der Funktionalen Sicherheit nach ISO 26262 im Zusammenhang steht. Es wird deutlich, dass vor Beginn einer Konzeptphase nach ISO 26262 schon ein konsolidiertes Verständnis über die Grundzüge der Automatisierungsfunktion vorliegen sollte. In diesem Kapitel wird dargestellt, wie der Nachweis der korrekten Sollfunktion mit den Aktivitäten im „aufsteigenden Ast“ des Vorgehensmodells der Funktionalen Sicherheit nach ISO 26262 verflochten werden kann, damit Synergiepotenziale in der Testplanung und -durchführung genutzt werden können.

%T Analysis of Safety of The Intended Use (SOTIF)
%P 14
%X The ISO/PAS 21448 Safety Of The Intended Function (SOTIF) standard recommends the continuous improvement of autonomous drivers to maximize the portion of known safe scenarios. Whereas control on individual outcomes is limited, engineering processes must exert control over the continuous improvement of overall performance statistics. The required quantitative analysis is performed by combining residual risk analysis, hazard modeling and Bayesian probabilistic reasoning. To account for the scope increase associated with automation above level 2, we extend mainstream standards to encompass multiple vehicles. We clarify how sneak conditions contribute to unsafe outcomes without failure, and explain how traditional tools need to be extended. We detail methods for modeling a driving loop in which perception algorithms are trained to detect hazards and the decision logic actively avoids accidents. The resulting uniﬁed hazard models rely on quantitative phenomenological characteristics that can be calibrated against ground truth obtained on the test track. We propose a scenario requirement speciﬁcation process, and describe an incremental process for assembling scenario libraries which can be used for continuous integration. We show how to apply machine learning paradigm to enable development against unknown scenarios and enable interpretability of driver logic. Finally, we show how to quantitatively compare autonomous drivers and discriminate incremental improvements from regression using posterior probabilities.

%T Dynamic Security Risk Management Using Bayesian Attack Graphs
%V 9

%P 61-74
%U 10.1109/TDSC.2011.34
%X Security risk assessment and mitigation are two vital processes that need to be executed to maintain a productive IT infrastructure. On one hand, models such as attack graphs and attack trees have been proposed to assess the cause-consequence relationships between various network states, while on the other hand, different decision problems have been explored to identify the minimum-cost hardening measures. However, these risk models do not help reason about the causal dependencies between network states. Further, the optimization formulations ignore the issue of resource availability while analyzing a risk model. In this paper, we propose a risk management framework using Bayesian networks that enable a system administrator to quantify the chances of network compromise at various levels. We show how to use this information to develop a security mitigation and management plan. In contrast to other similar models, this risk model lends itself to dynamic analysis during the deployed phase of the network. A multiobjective optimization platform provides the administrator with all trade-off information required to make decisions in a resource constrained environment.

%X Attack graphs are a powerful tool for security risk assessment by analysing network vulnerabilities and the paths attackers can use to compromise network resources. The uncertainty about the attacker’s behaviour makes Bayesian networks suitable to model attack graphs to perform static and dynamic analysis. Previous approaches have focused on the formalization of attack graphs into a Bayesian model rather than proposing mechanisms for their analysis. In this paper we propose to use efﬁcient algorithms to make exact inference in Bayesian attack graphs, enabling the static and dynamic network risk assessments. To support the validity of our approach we have performed an extensive experimental evaluation on synthetic Bayesian attack graphs with different topologies, showing the computational advantages in terms of time and memory use of the proposed techniques when compared to existing approaches.

%X Enforcing a variety of security measures (such as intrusion detection systems, and so on) can provide a certain level of protection to computer networks. However, such security practices often fall short in face of zero-day attacks. Due to the information asymmetry between attackers and defenders, detecting zero-day attacks remains a challenge. Instead of targeting individual zero-day exploits, revealing them on an attack path is a substantially more feasible strategy. Such attack paths that go through one or more zero-day exploits are called zero-day attack paths. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach and implement a prototype system ZePro for zero-day attack path identiﬁcation. In our approach, a zero-day attack path is essentially a graph. To capture the zero-day attack, a dependency graph named object instance graph is ﬁrst built as a supergraph by analyzing system calls. To further reveal the zero-day attack paths hidden in the supergraph, our system builds a Bayesian network based upon the instance graph. By taking intrusion evidence as input, the Bayesian network is able to compute the probabilities of object instances being infected. Connecting the high-probability-instances through dependency relations forms a path, which is the zero-day attack path. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of ZePro for zero-day attack path identiﬁcation.

%X Internet of Things (IoT) security and privacy remain a major challenge, mainly due to the massive scale and distributed nature of IoT networks. Blockchain-based approaches provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve signiﬁcant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices. In our previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof of Work (POW) and the concept of coins. Our approach was exempliﬁed in a smart home setting and consists of three main tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home. In this paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components and functions of the smart home tier. Each smart home is equipped with an always online, high resource device, known as ”miner” that is responsible for handling all communication within and external to the home. The miner also preserves a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing communications. We show that our proposed BC-based smart home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security with respect to the fundamental security goals of conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability. Finally, we present simulation results to highlight that the overheads (in terms of trafﬁc, processing time and energy consumption) introduced by our approach are insigniﬁcant relative to its security and privacy gains.

%T Design of Pedestrian target selection with Funnel Map for Pedestrian AEB System
%P 1-1
%U http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7556302/
%X Recently, numerous vehicles have been installed with an autonomous emergency braking (AEB) system for protecting pedestrians. This system helps in avoiding or reducing accidents by alerting the driver and controlling the automatic brake actuator before an accident. Moreover, the European New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) has stipulated AEB pedestrian systems as a standard requirement since 2016. This paper presents pedestrian target selection using a funnel map for a pedestrian AEB system. The concept of target selection is based on crash probability calculations by comparing the pedestrian’s predicted position and the current position to deduce the vehicle speed before an accident occurs. It is necessary to allow early breaking to avoid an accident. To determine the precise warning and brake timing, the warning distance is calculated using the vehicle and sensor fusion information. The pedestrian target selection algorithm is tested using a real vehicle on a test track in three different scenarios for the Euro NCAP using a pedestrian dummy authorized by the Euro NCAP. Upon comparing the results before and after the application of the proposed algorithm, the longitudinal distance is shown to have a maximum margin of 1.5 m, and the vehicle speed has a maximum reduction effect of 24.7 km/h. Test results show that the proposed pedestrian AEB system can avoid or mitigate an accident when the vehicle travels at speeds up to 40 km/h.

%T DLattice: A Permission-Less Blockchain Based on DPoS-BA-DAG Consensus for Data Tokenization
%V 7
%P 39273-39287
%U https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8672629/
%X In today’s digital information age, the conﬂict between the public’s growing awareness of their own data protection and the data owners’ inability to obtain data ownership has become increasingly prominent. The emergence of blockchain provides a new direction for data protection and data tokenization. Nonetheless, existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin using Proof-of-Work are particularly energy intensive. On the other hand, classical protocols such as Byzantine agreement do not work efﬁciently in an open environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a permission-less blockchain with a novel double-DAG (directed acyclic graph) architecture called DLattice, where each account has its own Account-DAG and all accounts make up a greater Node-DAG structure. DLattice parallelizes the growth of each account’s Account-DAG, each of which is not inﬂuenced by other accounts’ irrelevant transactions. DLattice uses a new DPoS-BA-DAG(PANDA) protocol to reach consensus among users only when the forks are observed. Based on proposed DLattice, we introduce a process of data tokenization, including data assembling, data anchoring, and data authorization. We implement DLattice and evaluate its performance on 25 ECS virtual machines, simulating up to 500 nodes. The experimental results show that DLattice reaches a consensus in 10 seconds, achieves desired throughput, and incurs almost no penalty for scaling to more users.

%X Blockchain has been widely recognized as the trust machine underpinning the Internet of Things(IoT). However, the poor performance of the existing mainstream platforms renders this expectation unattainable. New technologies like DAG and Hashgraph emerge as promising candidates to address the pressing issues, but their abilities in decentralized consensus are still in question. We propose a 3D-DAG model to address the trilemma of decentralization, scalability and security. Experiment results show that, by adopting the separation of concerns(SOC) architectural principle and a software deﬁned chain(SDC) approach, 3D-DAG can meet challenging requirements expected by IoT applications.

%X While the intersection of blockchains and the Internet of Things (IoT) have received considerable research interest lately, Nakamoto-style blockchains possess a number of qualities that make them poorly suited for many IoT scenarios. Specifically, they require high network connectivity and are powerintensive. This is a drawback in IoT environments where batteryconstrained nodes form an unreliable ad hoc network such as in digital agriculture. In this paper we present Vegvisir, a partitiontolerant blockchain for use in power-constrained IoT environments with limited network connectivity. It is a permissioned, directed acyclic graph (DAG)-structured blockchain that can be used to create a shared, tamperproof data repository that keeps track of data provenance. We discuss the use cases, architecture, and challenges of such a blockchain.

%X Internet of Things (IoT) plays an indispensable role in our daily life, in many cases, IoT systems are implemented following the client-server paradigm, which are vulnerable to single point of failures and malicious attacks. Due to the resilience and security promise of blockchain, the idea of combining blockchain and IoT has gained considerable attention in recent years. However, blockchains are power-intensive and low-throughput, which may not suitable for power-constrained IoT devices. To tackle these challenges, we present B-IoT, a blockchain based IoT system with credit-based consensus mechanism. We propose a credit-based proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism for IoT devices, which enhances security and improves transaction efﬁciency simultaneously. In order to protect the conﬁdentiality of sensitive IoT data, we design a data authority management method to regulate the access to sensor data. In addition, our system is built based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-structured blockchain, which is more efﬁcient than the satoshi-style blockchain. We implement a prototype of B-IoT on Raspberry Pi, and conduct case studies of a smart factory. Extensive evaluation and analysis results demonstrate that the proposed credit-based PoW mechanism and data access control are practical for IoT.

%T A Comparative Analysis of DAG-Based Blockchain Architectures
%P 27-34
%X Blockchain is a shared distributed ledger that promises tamper-proof secure transactions over the highly available and resilient network involving multiple participants. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) has revolutionized the blockchain technology. Owing to its optimized validation mechanism, high scalability, efficient provenance, support for IoT and multiparty involvement, DAG is rapidly over-shadowing traditional blockchain architecture. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of most popular DAG based blockchain architectures including Nxt, IOTA, Orumesh, DagCoin,Byteball, Nano and XDAG. The comparison is based on the functional data structures for maintaining the ledger, consensus algorithms, transaction validation, ledger size, scalability and popularity. Extracting the best features various DAG based blockchains, we move on to outline the best of all worlds DAG-based blockchain architecture.

%P 1-1
%X Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has been widely used in many fields. Meanwhile, blockchain is considered promising to address the issues of IIoT. However, the current blockchains have limited throughput. In this paper, we devise an efficient and secure blockchain protocol CoDAG based on compacted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where blocks are organized in levels and width. New-generated blocks in CoDAG will be placed appropriately, and point to those in the previous level, making it a well connected channel. Transactions in the network will be confirmed in a deterministic period, and CoDAG keeps a simple data structure at the same time. We also illustrate the attack strategies by adversary, and it is proved that our protocols are resistant to these attacks. Furthermore, we design a CoDAG-based IIoT architecture to improve the efficiency of IIoT system. Experimental results show that CoDAG achieves 164× Bitcoin's throughput and 77× Ethererum's throughput respectively.

%T Practical Secure Aggregation for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Keith
%V 41
%N 1
%P 65-74
%X —We design a novel, communication-efficient, failure-robust protocol for secure aggregation of high-dimensional data. Our protocol allows a server to compute the sum of large, user-held data vectors from mobile devices in a secure manner (i.e. without learning each user's individual contribution), and can be used, for example, in a federated learning setting, to aggregate user-provided model updates for a deep neural network. We prove the security of our protocol in the honest-but-curious and malicious settings, and show that security is maintained even if an arbitrarily chosen subset of users drop out at any time. We evaluate the efficiency of our protocol and show, by complexity analysis and a concrete implementation, that its runtime and communication overhead remain low even on large data sets and client pools. For 16-bit input values, our protocol offers 1.73× communication expansion for 2 10 users and 2 20 -dimensional vectors, and 1.98× expansion for 2 14 users and 2 24 -dimensional vectors over sending data in the clear.

%T Network under joint node and link attacks: Vulnerability assessment methods and analysis
%V 23
%N 3
%P 1001-1011
%X Critical infrastructures such as communication networks, electrical grids, and transportation systems are highly vulnerable to natural disasters and malicious attacks. Even failures of few nodes or links may have a profound impact on large parts of the system. Traditionally, network vulnerability assessment methods separate the studies of node vulnerability and link vulnerability, and thus ignore joint node and link attack schemes that may cause grave damage to the network. To this end, we introduce a new assessment method, called ?-disruptor, that unifies both link and node vulnerability assessment. The new assessment method is formulated as an optimization problem in which we aim to identify a minimum-cost set of mixed links and nodes whose removal would severely disrupt the network connectivity. We prove the NP-completeness of the problem and propose an O(?logn) bicriteria approximation algorithm for the ?-disruptor problem. This new theoretical guarantee improves the best approximation results for both link and node vulnerability assessment in literature. We further enhance the proposed algorithm by embedding it into a special combination of simulated annealing and variable neighborhood search method. The results of our extensive simulation-based experiments on synthetic and real networks show the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed vulnerability assessment methods.

%T CVSS-based security metrics for quantitative analysis of attack graphs
%N Iccke
%P 178-183
%X Attack graphs are efficient tools for detecting possible attacks in the network and their causes. By analyzing attack graphs and eliminating causes of attacks in the networks, we can immune networks against known intrusions. The main shortcoming of attack graphs is that they give no information about the damages of the possible attacks in the network. On the other hand by attack graphs, we can only analyze network security qualitatively. In this paper we propose a method that can measure the impact of each shown attack in the attack graph on the security parameters (Confidentiality, Availability and Integrity) of the network. In the proposed approach we have defined some security metrics by combining CVSS framework and attack graph. The main problem with the existing approaches is that, they cannot consider interrelation between vulnerabilities of the network efficiently. Our defined security metrics can address this issue and help us to assess network security quantitatively by analyzing attack graphs. By applying proposed security metrics on each network's attack graph we can find the most perilous vulnerability in the network.

%X Cloud computing is becoming more and more popular and its security is arising as well. In order to solve security issues and take security evaluation in cloud computing, its corresponding hierarchical security design model is introduced and an approach of security evaluation based on attack graph is proposed in cloud computing environment. Firstly, network threat model and automatic methods are presented to get information for generating attack graph automatically. By using symbolic model checking algorithm, attack graph is generated and visualized. Then, by combining the characteristics of Markov Chain with attack graph, two security evaluation metrics are proposed in cloud computing. They can be used for security evaluation, security hardness and give security suggestions in cloud computing. © 2012 IEEE.

%X Guarding against network intrusions requires the monitoring of network traffic for particular network segments or devices and analysis of network, transport, and application protocols to identify suspicious activity. This chapter provides a detailed discussion of network-based intrusion protection technologies. It contains a brief overview of the major components of network-based intrusion protection systems and explains the architectures typically used for deploying the components. It also examines the security capabilities of the technologies in depth, including the methodologies they use to identify suspicious activity. The rest of the chapter discusses the management capabilities of the technologies and provides recommendations for implementation and operation.

%T Applying attack graphs to network security metric
%V 1
%P 427-431
%X Since attack graphs provide practical attack context and relationships among vulnerabilities, researchers have been trying to evaluate network security based on attack graphs. However, previous works focus their attention on specific evaluations they concerned, and each does things in his own way. There is no explicit way telling network administrators how to measure network security in a general way. In this paper, we propose a new metric framework, whose main goal is to guide people to perform evaluations based on attack graphs. The main components of proposed metric framework include security index, target of evaluation, elementary attribute, composition algorithm, and arithmetic operators. Relative definitions and analysis of these five components are also given. The following examples show the applications of our metric framework, and validate it.

%X In addition to the graphic-editing facilities, the software tool Tina proposes the construction of a number of representations for the behaviour of Petri nets or Time Petri nets. Various techniques are used to extract views of the behaviour of nets, preserving certain classes of properties of their state spaces. For Petri nets, these abstractions help prevent combinatorial explosion, relying on so-called partial order techniques such as covering steps and/or persistent sets. For Time Petri nets, which have, in general, infinite state spaces, they provide a finite symbolic representation of their behaviour in terms of state classes.

%T An attack graph based network security evaluation model for hierarchical network
%P 208-211
%X To evaluate the security situation of hierarchical network, a novel evaluation algorithm based on the method of constructing a security risk function is proposed. The proposed algorithm is the aggregation of qualitative evaluation and quantitative evaluation. We quantify the asset loss (AL) and the threat value of each attack step (TVA) basing on attack graph, and adjust the loss of assets that are of the same type and have different uses with coefficient of asset importance (CAI). Then, we construct a risk evaluation function which is based on the above three parameters. Thus, the assessment score gotten through the evaluation function can comprehensively reflect the risk value including loss, threat of an attack step, and importance of the suffering entity. Finally, we get the risk value by fusing all subnets' risk value in one area, and divide the risk value into 4 security levels. Seen from the case study, the model solves the security evaluation problem for hierarchical network simply and efficiently.

%X Historically, vendors have used their own methods for scoring software vulnerabilities, usually without detailing their criteria or processes. This creates a major problem for users, particularly those who manage disparate IT systems and applications. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a public initiative designed to address this issue by presenting a framework for assessing and quantifying the impact of software vulnerabilities. Organizations currently generating CVSS scores include Cisco, US National Institute of Standards and Technology (through the US National Vulnerability Database; NVD), Qualys, Oracle, and Tenable Network Security. CVSS offers the following benefits: 1) standardized vulnerability scores, 2) contextual scoring and 3) open framework. The goal is for CVSS to facilitate the generation of consistent scores that accurately represent the impact of vulnerabilities

To support this assessment, we have developed an integrated set of tools, the Haruspex suite. Some of its tools build the models of the target system and those of the agents that other tools apply to simulate the agent attacks. Further tools analyze the output of the simulation. After outlining the proposed approach and the suite, we describe the assessments of two industrial control systems that supervise, respectively, a thermoelectric generation plan and a hydroelectric one. To simplify the presentation of the output of these assessments, we introduce the security stress, a synthetic measure of how a system resists to attacks.

%X Computer systems are vulnerable to both known and zero-day attacks. Although known attack patterns can be easily modeled, thus enabling the development of suitable hardening strategies, handling zero-day vulnerabilities is inherently difficult due to their unpredictable nature. Previous research has attempted to assess the risk associated with unknown attack patterns, and a suitable metric to quantify such risk, the k-zero-day safety metric, has been defined. However, existing algorithms for computing this metric are not scalable, and assume that complete zero-day attack graphs have been generated, which may be unfeasible in practice for large networks. In this paper, we propose a set of polynomial algorithms for estimating the k-zero-day safety of possibly large networks efficiently, without pre-computing the entire attack graph. We validate our approach through experiments, and show that the proposed algorithms are computationally efficient and accurate.

%X The development of software components for autonomous driving functions should always include an extensive and rigorous evaluation. Since real-world testing is expensive and safetycritical – especially when facing dynamic racing scenarios at the limit of handling – a favored approach is simulation-based testing. In this work, we propose an open-source graphical user interface, which allows the generation of a multi-vehicle scenario in a regular or even a race environment. The underlying method and implementation is elaborated in detail. Furthermore, we showcase the potential usecases for the scenario-based validation of a safety assessment module, integrated into an autonomous driving software stack. Within this scope, we introduce three illustrative scenarios, each focusing on a different safety-critical aspect.

%X Digital twin (DT) is one of the most promising enabling technologies for realizing smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0. DTs are characterized by the seamless integration between the cyber and physical spaces. The importance of DTs is increasingly recognized by both academia and industry. It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry. This paper also outlines the current challenges and some possible directions for future work.

%X The vision of the Digital Twin itself refers to a comprehensive physical and functional description of a component, product or system, which includes more or less all information which could be useful in all—the current and subsequent—lifecycle phases. In this chapter we focus on the simulation aspects of the Digital Twin. Today, modelling and simulation is a standard process in system development, e.g. to support design tasks or to validate system properties. During operation and for service first simulation-based solutions are realized for optimized operations and failure prediction. In this sense, simulation merges the physical and virtual world in all life cycle phases. Current practice already enables the users (designer, SW/HW developers, test engineers, operators, maintenance personnel, etc) to master the complexity of mechatronic systems.

%X Digital Twin technology is an emerging concept that has become the centre of attention for industry and, in more recent years, academia. The advancements in industry 4.0 concepts have facilitated its growth, particularly in the manufacturing industry. The Digital Twin is defined extensively but is best described as the effortless integration of data between a physical and virtual machine in either direction. The challenges, applications, and enabling technologies for Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT) and Digital Twins are presented. A review of publications relating to Digital Twins is performed, producing a categorical review of recent papers. The review has categorised them by research areas: manufacturing, healthcare and smart cities, discussing a range of papers that reflect these areas and the current state of research. The paper provides an assessment of the enabling technologies, challenges and open research for Digital Twins.

%T Discovering Hidden Variables in Noisy-Or Networks using Quartet Tests
%P 9
%X We give a polynomial-time algorithm for provably learning the structure and parameters of bipartite noisy-or Bayesian networks of binary variables where the top layer is completely hidden. Unsupervised learning of these models is a form of discrete factor analysis, enabling the discovery of hidden variables and their causal relationships with observed data. We obtain an efﬁcient learning algorithm for a family of Bayesian networks that we call quartet-learnable. For each latent variable, the existence of a singly-coupled quartet allows us to uniquely identify and learn all parameters involving that latent variable. We give a proof of the polynomial sample complexity of our learning algorithm, and experimentally compare it to variational EM.

%V 2020
%P 1-11
%U https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2020/3701067/
%X Most of the traditional cryptanalytic technologies often require a great amount of time, known plaintexts, and memory. This paper proposes a generic cryptanalysis model based on deep learning (DL), where the model tries to find the key of block ciphers from known plaintext-ciphertext pairs. We show the feasibility of the DL-based cryptanalysis by attacking on lightweight block ciphers such as simplified DES, Simon, and Speck. The results show that the DL-based cryptanalysis can successfully recover the key bits when the keyspace is restricted to 64 ASCII characters. The traditional cryptanalysis is generally performed without the keyspace restriction, but only reduced-round variants of Simon and Speck are successfully attacked. Although a text-based key is applied, the proposed DL-based cryptanalysis can successfully break the full rounds of Simon32/64 and Speck32/64. The results indicate that the DL technology can be a useful tool for the cryptanalysis of block ciphers when the keyspace is restricted.

%X The ISO 26262 standard addresses system failures and the need to mitigate them safely. However, the standard is only implicit regarding the safety of the intended functionality. One should concede that a system without failures, operating in the specified design boundaries should be safe. None the less, the new ISO/PAS 21448 standard on Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) only explicitly addresses unintended functionality as it pertains to the design of the product, purportedly in the absence of any system, element or component failures. How can this have happened? What guarantees that contemporary complex computer steered systems always behave well under normal circumstances without showing any unexpected and deviant behavior that can be potentially hazardous to the user? How can this conundrum be amended? This paper explores the actual reality of failures in complex systems that rely on complex sub-systems to produce the desired functionality. We challenge the notion that the ISO 26262 and the ISO 21488 standards are presently sufficient in its guidance to resolve this enigma.

%T UNO: Uncertainty-aware Noisy-Or Multimodal Fusion for Unanticipated Input Degradation
%P 5716-5723
%U 10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197266
%X The fusion of multiple sensor modalities, especially through deep learning architectures, has been an active area of study. However, an under-explored aspect of such work is whether the methods can be robust to degradation across their input modalities, especially when they must generalize to degradation not seen during training. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware fusion scheme to effectively fuse inputs that might suffer from a range of known and unknown degradation. Specifically, we analyze a number of uncertainty measures, each of which captures a different aspect of uncertainty, and we propose a novel way to fuse degraded inputs by scaling modality-specific output softmax probabilities. We additionally propose a novel data-dependent spatial temperature scaling method to complement these existing uncertainty measures. Finally, we integrate the uncertainty-scaled output from each modality using a probabilistic noisy-or fusion method. In a photo-realistic simulation environment (AirSim), we show that our method achieves significantly better results on a semantic segmentation task, as compared to state-of-art fusion architectures, on a range of degradation (e.g. fog, snow, frost, and various other types of noise), some of which are unknown during training.

%U 10.1109/MCNA50957.2020.9264279
%X The performance of Deep Neural Networks in field of computer vision as most attractive segment of current trends in automotive is not just remarkable, but also quite beneficial in comparison to the classic SW approaches, since many hundred thousand lines of codes can be easily replaced. On the other side, a completely different development process makes them not fully conform to the requirements of current standards for functional safety in automotive, ISO 26262 and SOTIF. Analyzing Deep Learning Networks from the perspective of classic SW approach was the first try to address the drawbacks and deviations from the current standards. Although worthwhile, such studies didn’t provide concepts, how to develop DNNs in a systematic, transparent and assessable way.This paper introduces a novel concept for the development of deep neural networks considering their characteristics, overcoming the drawback with tool evaluation process of wide established frameworks (such as TensorFlow, Keras etc.) and providing a systematic, traceable and assessable solution.

%T Cube-Attack-Like Cryptanalysis of Round-Reduced Keccak Using MILP
%P 32
%X Cube-attack-like cryptanalysis on round-reduced Keccak was proposed by Dinur et al. at EUROCRYPT 2015. It recovers the key through two phases: the preprocessing phase for precomputing a look-up table and online phase for querying the output and getting the cube sum with which the right key can be retrieved by looking up the precomputed table. It was shown that such attacks are eﬃcient speciﬁcally for Keccak-based constructions with small nonce or message block size. In this paper, we provide a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for cubeattack-like cryptanalysis on keyed Keccak, which does not impose any unnecessary constraint on cube variables and ﬁnds almost optimal cubes by balancing the two phases of cube-attack-like cryptanalysis. Our model is applied to Ketje Jr, Ketje Sr, a Xoodoo-based authenticated encryption and Keccak-MAC-512, all of which have a relatively small nonce or message block size. As a result, time complexities of 5-round attacks on Ketje Jr and 7-round attacks on Ketje Sr can be improved signiﬁcantly. Meanwhile, 6-round attacks, one more round than the previous best attack, are possible if the key size of Ketje V1 (V2) is reduced to 72 (80) bits. For Xoodoo-based AE in Ketje style, the attack reaches 6 rounds. Additionally, a 7-round attack of Keccak-MAC-512 is achieved. To verify the correctness of our attacks, a 5-round attack on Ketje V1 is implemented and tested practically. It is noted that this work does not threaten the security of any Keccak-based construction.

%X Division property is a generalized integral property proposed by Todo at EUROCRYPT 2015, and very recently, Todo et al. proposed bit-based division property and applied to SIMON32 at FSE 2016. However, this technique can only be applied to block ciphers with block size no larger than 32 due to its high time and memory complexity. In this paper, we extend Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method, which is used to search diﬀerential characteristics and linear trails of block ciphers, to search integral distinguishers of block ciphers based on division property with block size larger than 32.

%T MILP-Aided Bit-Based Division Property for ARX-Based Block Cipher
%P 31
%X The huge time and memory complexities of utilizing bitbased division property, which was ﬁrst presented by Todo and Morri at FSE 2016, bothered cryptographers for quite some time and it had been solved by Xiang et al. at ASIACRYPT 2016. They applied MILP method to search integral distinguisher based on division property, and used it to analyze six lightweight block ciphers. Later on, Sun et al. handled the feasibility of MILP-aided bit-based division property for primitives with non-bit-permutation linear layers. Although MILP-aided bit-based division property has gave many perfect results since its appearance, there still are many left problems when we want to develop its further applications. In this paper, we focus on the feasibility of MILP-aided bit-based division property for ARX-based primitive. More speciﬁcally, we consider the construction of MILP models for some components of ARX-based structure. Firstly, the Modulo model is proposed by using its iterated expression and introducing some auxiliary variables. Then, to propagate the operations of AND and OR with a constant (or a subkey), we prove that the known-region deduced by the input division property is always included in the known-region derived from the output division property, which allows us to ignore these operations. Furthermore, with its help, we also handle the Modulo operation with a constant (or a subkey). As a result, these new models are exploited to search integral distinguishers for some ARX-based block ciphers. For HIGHT and LEA, the lengths of the distinguishers both are improved by one round. Some 15-round integral distinguishers for TEA/XTEA are presented. Comparing with the existing one transformed by utilizing the equivalence between zerocorrelation and integral cryptanalysis, our newly obtained distinguishers either reduces the data requirement or increases the number of zerosum bits. Moreover, the bit-based division properties for KATAN and KTANTAN families of block ciphers are also provided.

%X We propose two systematic methods to describe the diﬀerential property of an S-box with linear inequalities based on logical condition modelling and computational geometry respectively. In one method, inequalities are generated according to some conditional diﬀerential properties of the S-box; in the other method, inequalities are extracted from the H-representation of the convex hull of all possible diﬀerential patterns of the S-box. For the second method, we develop a greedy algorithm for selecting a given number of inequalities from the convex hull. Using these inequalities combined with Mixedinteger Linear Programming (MILP) technique, we propose an automatic method for evaluating the security of bit-oriented block ciphers against the (related-key) diﬀerential attack, and several techniques for obtaining tighter security bounds. We successfully prove that the 24-round PRESENT-80 is secure enough to resist against standard related-key diﬀerential attacks based on diﬀerential characteristic, and the probability of the best related-key diﬀerential characteristic of the full LBlock is upper bounded by 2−60. These are the tightest security bounds with respect to the related-key diﬀerential attack published so far for PRESENT-80 and LBlock.

%T New Conditional Cube Attack on Keccak Keyed Modes
%P 32
%X The conditional cube attack on round-reduced Keccak keyed modes was proposed by Huang et al. at EUROCRYPT 2017. In their attack, a conditional cube variable was introduced, whose diﬀusion was signiﬁcantly reduced by certain key bit conditions. The attack requires a set of cube variables which are not multiplied in the ﬁrst round while the conditional cube variable is not multiplied with other cube variables (called ordinary cube variables) in the ﬁrst two rounds. This has an impact on the degree of the output of Keccak and hence gives a distinguisher. Later, the MILP method was applied to ﬁnd ordinary cube variables. However, for some Keccak based versions with few degrees of freedom, one could not ﬁnd enough ordinary cube variables, which weakens or even invalidates the conditional cube attack.

%X Since Keccak was selected as SHA-3 hash function by NIST, it has attracted considerable attention from cryptographic researchers. Keccak sponge function [1] has also been used to design message authentication codes (MAC) and authenticated encryption (AE) scheme Keyak. Till now, the most eﬃcient key recovery attacks on Keccak-MAC and Keyak are cube attacks and cube-attack-like cryptanalysis proposed at EUROCRYPT’15. In this paper, we provide a new type of cube distinguisher named conditional cube tester for Keccak sponge function, where we append some bit conditions for some cube variables to reduce the dimension of the original cube tester. We apply the conditional cube tester to recover the key for reduced-round Keccak-MAC and Keyak. Compared to the previous key recovery attacks for Keccak-MAC and Keyak, our attacks are the best attacks according to the number of rounds or the complexity. Moreover, by constructing an MILP (mixed integer linear programming) model, we provide a searching algorithm to produce the most eﬃcient conditional cube tester, which can be utilized as a distinguisher for Keccak sponge function. As a result, we improve the previous distinguishing attacks on Keccak sponge function. Although the attacks in this paper are the best ones compared with previous results, they cannot threat the security margin of Keccak sponge function.

%T Cryptanalysis of Subterranean-SAE
%P 33
%X Subterranean 2.0 designed by Daemen, Massolino and Rotella is a Round 1 candidate of the NIST Lightweight Cryptography Standardization process. In the oﬃcial document of Subterranean 2.0, the designers have made a cryptanalysis of the state collisions in unkeyed absorbing by reducing the number of rounds to absorb the message from 2 to 1. However, little cryptanalysis of the authenticated encryption scheme Subterranean-SAE is made. For SubterraneanSAE, the designers introduce 8 blank rounds to separate the controllable input and output, and expect that 8 blank rounds can achieve a suﬃcient diﬀusion. Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate the security by reducing the number of blank rounds. Moreover, the designers make no security claim but expect a non-trivial eﬀort to achieve full-state recovery in a nonce-misuse scenario. In this paper, we present the ﬁrst full-state recovery attack in a nonce-misuse scenario with practical time complexity 216. In addition, in a nonce-respecting scenario and if the number of blank rounds is reduced to 4, we can mount a key-recovery attack with time complexity 2122 and data complexity 269.5. The distinguishing attack can also be achieved with time and data complexity 233. Our cryptanalysis does not threaten the security claim for Subterranean-SAE and we hope it can enhance the understanding of Subterranean-SAE.

%T Cryptanalysis of Reduced-Round SipHash
%P 21
%X SipHash is a family of ARX-based MAC algorithms optimized for short inputs. Already, a lot of implementations and applications for SipHash have been proposed, whereas the cryptanalysis of SipHash still lacks behind. In this paper, we study the property of truncated differential in SipHash and find out the output bits with the most imbalanced differential biases. Based on these results, we construct distinguishers with practical complexity 210 for SipHash-2-1 and 236 for SipHash-2-2. We further reveal the relations between the value of output bias and the difference after first modular addition step, which is directly determined by corresponding key bits. Making use of these relations, we propose a key recovery method for SipHash-2-1 with success rate increased from 2−128 to 2−41.

%X This paper analyzes the internal keyed permutation of FlexAEAD which is a round-1 candidate of NIST LightWeight Cryptography Competition. In our analysis, we report an iterated truncated diﬀerential leveraging on a particular property of the AES Sbox that becomes useful due to the particular nature of diﬀusion layer of the round function. The diﬀerential holds with a low probability of 2−7 for one round which allows it to penetrate the same number of rounds as claimed by the designers, but with a much less complexity. Moreover, it can be easily extended to a key-recovery attack at little extra cost. We further report a Super-Sbox construction in the internal permutation, which is exploited using the Yoyo game to devise a 6-round deterministic distinguisher and a 7-round key recovery attack for 128-bit internal permutation. Similar attacks can be mounted for the 64-bit and 256-bit variants. All these attacks are favorably compared with the existing results of the designers as well as other third party results. The iterated truncated diﬀerentials can be tweaked to mount forgery attacks similar to the ones given by Eichlseder et al.. Success probabilities of all the reported distinguishing attacks are shown to be high. All practical attacks have been experimentally veriﬁed. To the best of our knowledge, this work reports the ﬁrst key-recovery attack on the internal keyed permutation of FlexAEAD.

%T Practical Forgery Attacks on Limdolen and HERN
%P 18
%X In this paper, we investigate the security of Limdolen and HERN which are Round 1 submissions of the ongoing NIST Lightweight Cryptography Standardization Project. We show that some non-conservative design choices made by the designers solely to achieve a lightweight design lead to practical forgery attacks. In particular, we create associated data-only, ciphertext-only and associated data and ciphertext forgeries which require a feasible number of forging attempts.

%X MD5 is one of the most widely used cryptographic hash functions nowadays. It was designed in 1992 as an improvement of MD4, and its security was widely studied since then by several authors. The best known result so far was a semi free-start collision, in which the initial value of the hash function is replaced by a non-standard value, which is the result of the attack. In this paper we present a new powerful attack on MD5 which allows us to ﬁnd collisions eﬃciently. We used this attack to ﬁnd collisions of MD5 in about 15 minutes up to an hour computation time. The attack is a diﬀerential attack, which unlike most diﬀerential attacks, does not use the exclusive-or as a measure of diﬀerence, but instead uses modular integer subtraction as the measure. We call this kind of diﬀerential a modular diﬀerential. An application of this attack to MD4 can ﬁnd a collision in less than a fraction of a second. This attack is also applicable to other hash functions, such as RIPEMD and HAVAL.

%X Symmetric cryptographic primitives with low multiplicative complexity have been proposed to improve the performance of emerging applications such as secure Multi-Party Computation. However, primitives composed of round functions with low algebraic degree require a careful evaluation to assess their security against algebraic cryptanalysis, and in particular interpolation attacks. This paper proposes new low-memory interpolation attacks on symmetric key primitives of low degree. Moreover, we present generic attacks on block ciphers with a simple key schedule; our attacks require either constant memory or constant data complexity. The improved attack is applied to the block cipher MiMC which aims to minimize the number of multiplications in large ﬁnite ﬁelds. As a result, we can break MiMC-129/129 with 38 rounds with time and data complexity 265.5 and 260.2 respectively and with negligible memory; this attack invalidates one of the security claims of the designers. Our attack indicates that for MiMC-129/129 the full 82 rounds are necessary even with restrictions on the memory available to the attacker. For variants of MiMC with larger keys, we present new attacks with reduced complexity. Our results do not aﬀect the security claims of the full round MiMC.

%X TRIFLE is a Round 1 candidate of the NIST Lightweight Cryptography Standardization process. In this paper, we present an interesting 1-round iterative diﬀerential characteristic of the underlying block cipher TRIFLE-BC used in TRIFLE, which holds with probability of 2−3. Consequently, it allows to mount distinguishing attack on TRIFLE-BC for up to 43 (out of 50) rounds with data complexity 2124 and time complexity 2124. Most importantly, with such an iterative diﬀerential characteristic, the forgery attack on TRIFLE can reach up to 21 (out of 50) rounds with data complexity 263 and time complexity 263. Finally, to achieve key recovery attack on reduced TRIFLE, we construct a diﬀerential characteristic covering three blocks by carefully choosing the positions of the iterative diﬀerential characteristic. As a result, we can mount key-recovery attack on TRIFLE for up to 11 rounds with data complexity 263 and time complexity 2104. Although the result in this paper cannot threaten the security margin of TRIFLE, we hope it can help further understand the security of TRIFLE.

%X In this paper, we show structural cryptanalyses against two popular networks, i.e., the Feistel Network and the Substitute-Permutation Network (SPN). Our cryptanalyses are distinguishing attacks by an improved integral distinguisher. The integral distinguisher is one of the most powerful attacks against block ciphers, and it is usually constructed by evaluating the propagation characteristic of integral properties, e.g., the ALL or BALANCE property. However, the integral property does not derive useful distinguishers against block ciphers with non-bijective functions and bit-oriented structures. Moreover, since the integral property does not clearly exploit the algebraic degree of block ciphers, it tends not to construct useful distinguishers against block ciphers with low-degree functions. In this paper, we propose a new property called the division property, which is the generalization of the integral property. It can eﬀectively construct the integral distinguisher even if the block cipher has non-bijective functions, bit-oriented structures, and low-degree functions. From viewpoints of the attackable number of rounds or chosen plaintexts, the division property can construct better distinguishers than previous methods. Although our attack is a generic attack, it can improve several integral distinguishers against speciﬁc cryptographic primitives. For instance, it can reduce the required number of chosen plaintexts for the 10-round distinguisher on Keccak-f from 21025 to 2515. For the Feistel cipher, it theoretically proves that Simon 32, 48, 64, 96, and 128 have 9-, 11-, 11-, 13-, and 13-round integral distinguishers, respectively.

%T Generalized Related-Key Rectangle Attacks on Block Ciphers with Linear Key Schedule
%P 12
%X This paper gives a new generalized key-recovery model of related-key rectangle attacks on block ciphers with linear key schedules. The model is quite optimized and applicable to various block ciphers with linear key schedule. As a proof of work, we apply the new model to two very important block ciphers, i.e. SKINNY and GIFT, which are basic modules of many candidates of the Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) standardization project by NIST. For SKINNY, we reduce the complexity of the best previous 27-round related-tweakey rectangle attack on SKINNY-128-384 from 2331 to 2251.25. In addition, the ﬁrst 28-round related-tweakey rectangle attack on SKINNY-128-384 is given, which gains one more round than before. For the candidate LWC SKINNY AEAD M1, we conduct a 24-round related-tweakey rectangle attack with a time complexity of 2123 and a data complexity of 2123 chosen plaintexts. For the case of GIFT-64, we give the ﬁrst 24-round related-key rectangle attack with a time complexity 291.58, while the best previous attack on GIFT-64 only reaches 23 rounds at most.

%X Skipjack is the secret key encryption algorithm developed by the NSA for the Clipper chip and Fortezza PC card. It uses an 80-bit key, 128 table lookup operations, and 320 XOR operations to map a 64bit plaintext into a 64-bit ciphertext in 32 rounds. This paper describes an eﬃcient attack on a variant, which we call Skipjack-3XOR (Skipjack minus 3 XORs). The only diﬀerence between Skipjack and Skipjack3XOR is the removal of 3 out of the 320 XOR operations. The attack uses the ciphertexts derived from about 500 plaintexts and its total running time is equivalent to about one million Skipjack encryptions, which can be carried out in seconds on a personal computer. We also present a new cryptographic tool, which we call the Yoyo game, and eﬃcient attacks on Skipjack reduced to 16 rounds. We conclude that Skipjack does not have a conservative design with a large margin of safety.

First, we disprove the oft-repeated claim that eliminating all high-probability diﬀerentials for the whole cipher is suﬃcient to guarantee security against diﬀerential attacks. Second, we show how to break COCONUT98, a cipher designed using decorrelation techniques to ensure provable security against diﬀerential attacks, with an advanced diﬀerential-style attack that needs just 216 adaptively chosen texts. Also, to illustrate the power of boomerang techniques, we give new attacks on Khufu-16, FEAL-6, and 16 rounds of CAST-256.

%T RECTANGLE: a bit-slice lightweight block cipher suitable for multiple platforms
%V 58
%N 12
%P 1-15
%U http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11432-015-5459-7
%X In this paper, we propose a new lightweight block cipher named RECTANGLE. The main idea of the design of RECTANGLE is to allow lightweight and fast implementations using bit-slice techniques. RECTANGLE uses an SP-network. The substitution layer consists of 16 4 × 4 S-boxes in parallel. The permutation layer is composed of 3 rotations. As shown in this paper, RECTANGLE oﬀers great performance in both hardware and software environment, which provides enough ﬂexibility for diﬀerent application scenario. The following are 3 main advantages of RECTANGLE. First, RECTANGLE is extremely hardware-friendly. For the 80-bit key version, a one-cycle-per-round parallel implementation only needs 1600 gates for a throughput of 246 Kbits/sec at 100 KHz clock and an energy eﬃciency of 3.0 pJ/bit. Second, RECTANGLE achieves a very competitive software speed among the existing lightweight block ciphers due to its bit-slice style. Using 128-bit SSE instructions, a bit-slice implementation of RECTANGLE reaches an average encryption speed of about 3.9 cycles/byte for messages around 3000 bytes. Last, but not least, we propose new design criteria for the RECTANGLE S-box. Due to our careful selection of the S-box and the asymmetric design of the permutation layer, RECTANGLE achieves a very good security-performance tradeoﬀ. Our extensive and deep security analysis shows that the highest number of rounds that we can attack, is 18 (out of 25).

%X This paper has four main contributions.1 First, we calculate the predicted diﬀerence distribution of Speck32/64 with one speciﬁc input diﬀerence under the Markov assumption completely for up to eight rounds and verify that this yields a globally fairly good model of the diﬀerence distribution of Speck32/64. Secondly, we show that contrary to conventional wisdom, machine learning can produce very powerful cryptographic distinguishers: for instance, in a simple low-data, chosen plaintext attack on nine rounds of Speck, we present distinguishers based on deep residual neural networks that achieve a mean key rank roughly ﬁve times lower than an analogous classical distinguisher using the full diﬀerence distribution table. Thirdly, we develop a highly selective key search policy based on a variant of Bayesian optimization which, together with our neural distinguishers, can be used to reduce the remaining security of 11-round Speck32/64 to roughly 38 bits. This is a signiﬁcant improvement over previous literature. Lastly, we show that our neural distinguishers successfully use features of the ciphertext pair distribution that are invisible to all purely diﬀerential distinguishers even given unlimited data.

However, after the initial design a dedicated attack was mounted that forced us to augment the number of rounds. The goal of this paper is the publication of the resulting cipher for public scrutiny. A C implementation of SQUARE is available that runs at 2.63 MByte/s on a 100 MHz Pentium. Our M68HC05 Smart Card implementation fits in 547 bytes and takes less than 2 msec. (4 MHz Clock). The high degree of parallellism allows hardware implementations in the Gbit/s range today.

%X In ToSC 2017 Saha et al. demonstrated an interesting property of SHA3 based on higher-order vectorial derivatives which led to self-symmetry based distinguishers referred to as SymSum and bettered the complexity w.r.t the well-studied ZeroSum distinguisher by a factor of 4. This work attempts to take a fresh look at this distinguisher in the light of the linearization technique developed by Guo et al. in Asiacrypt 2016. It is observed that the eﬃciency of SymSum against ZeroSum drops from 4 to 2 for any number of rounds linearized. This is supported by theoretical proofs. SymSum augmented with linearization can penetrate up to two more rounds as against the classical version. In addition to that, one more round is extended by inversion technique on the ﬁnal hash values. The combined approach leads to distinguishers up to 9 rounds of SHA3 variants with a complexity of only 264 which is better than the equivalent ZeroSum distinguisher by the factor of 2. To the best of our knowledge this is the best distinguisher available on this many rounds of SHA3.

%X SKINNY is a lightweight tweakable block cipher which received a great deal of cryptanalytic attention following its elegant structure and eﬃciency. Inspired by the SKINNY competitions, multiple attacks on it were reported in diﬀerent settings (e.g. single vs. relatedtweakey) using diﬀerent techniques (impossible diﬀerentials, meet-in-themiddle, etc.). In this paper we revisit some of these attacks, identify issues with several of them, and oﬀer a series of improved attacks which were experimentally veriﬁed. Our best attack can attack up to 18 rounds using 260 chosen ciphertexts data, 2116 time, and 2112 memory.

Along this line, we perform an interpolation attack against Elephant-Delirium, a round 2 submission of the ongoing NIST lightweight cryptography project. This is the ﬁrst third-party cryptanalysis on this cipher. Moreover, we promote the interpolation attack by applying it to the Farfalle pseudo-random constructions Kravatte and Xooﬀf. Our attacks turn out to be the most eﬃcient method for these ciphers thus far.

In this paper we test the strength of the key scheduling algorithm (KSA) of the 80-bit key length variant of PRESENT by attempting to retrieve the main key register from the ﬁnal round key register, using deep learning.

%T Cryptanalysis of Full LowMC and LowMC-M with Algebraic Techniques
%P 34
%X In this paper, we revisit the diﬀerence enumeration techniques for LowMC and develop new algebraic techniques to achieve eﬃcient key-recovery attacks with negligible memory complexity. Beneﬁting from our technique to reduce the memory complexity, we could signiﬁcantly improve the attacks on LowMC when the block size is much larger than the key size and even break LowMC with such a kind of parameter. On the other hand, with our new key-recovery technique, we could signiﬁcantly improve the time to retrieve the full key if given only a single pair of input and output messages together with the diﬀerence trail that they take, which was stated as an interesting question by Rechberger et al. in ToSC 2018. Combining both the techniques, with only 2 chosen plaintexts, we could break 4 rounds of LowMC adopting a full S-Box layer with block size of 129, 192 and 255 bits, respectively, which are the 3 recommended parameters for Picnic3, an alternative third-round candidate in NIST’s Post-Quantum Cryptography competition. We have to emphasize that our attacks do not indicate that Picnic3 is broken as the Picnic use-case is very diﬀerent and an attacker cannot even freely choose 2 plaintexts to encrypt for a LowMC instantiation. However, such parameters are deemed as secure in the latest LowMC. Moreover, much more rounds of seven instances of the backdoor ciphers LowMC-M as proposed by Peyrin and Wang in CRYPTO 2020 can be broken without ﬁnding the backdoor by making full use of the allowed 264 data. The above mentioned attacks are all achieved with negligible memory.

%X We show that the underlying permutation of ChaCha20 stream cipher does not behave as a random permutation for up to 17 rounds with respect to rotational cryptanalysis. In particular, we derive a lower and an upper bound for the rotational probability through ChaCha quarter round, we show how to extend the bound to a full round and then to the full permutation. The obtained bounds show that the probability to ﬁnd what we call a parallel rotational collision is, for example, less than 2−488 for 17 rounds of ChaCha permutation, while for a random permutation of the same input size, this probability is 2−511. We remark that our distinguisher is not an attack to ChaCha20 stream cipher, but rather a theoretical analysis of its internal permutation from the point of view of rotational cryptanalysis.

%X Highly automated driving (HAD) vehicles are complex systems operating in an open context. Complexity of these systems as well as limitations and insufﬁciencies in sensing and understanding the open context may result in unsafe and uncertain behavior. The safety critical nature of the HAD vehicles demands to model limitations, insufﬁciencies and triggering conditions to argue safe behavior.

%X Take-over process refers to the situation where drivers are required to take over control of vehicles under certain conditions, which currently lacks safety analysis. To address this problem, Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is extended according to ISO 21448 for the safety analysis of a take-over system, which consists of a driver and a human-machine interface (HMI). First, system-level hazards are analyzed to develop safety constraints. Then, a control structure of the take-over process is modeled to identify unsafe control actions considering human factors. Finally, causal factors of the unsafe control actions are analyzed, and safety requirements regarding HMI are put forward to guide the design of the take-over system. This method was applied to analyze the take-over system of an autonomous vehicle operating in a closed area, and corresponding safety requirements were determined. Based on the results of a questionnaire survey and a take-over test, the analysis method is proved to be applicable to improving the safety of the take-over system.

%T Verification of HMI safety for process control systems: A formal approach
%P 188-191
%X Human factors have been recognized as one of the main sources of accidents. For a process control system, to ensure the safety of its human machine interface (HMI) is of great importance to different levels of system design and implementation. Traditional safety analysis approach to a process control system involves the using of expert experiences and generic system safety techniques. However, such an approach does not usually consider the discretionary nature of human behavior. This paper proposes a formal approach to the safety verification of the HMI design of process control systems. Safety properties are formalized using computation tree logic; and the dynamic behavior of the operator, the hardware interface the control instrument and the HMI control logic are modeled using timed automata. Finally, an industrial case is provided to illustrate the verification procedure.

%T Towards guidelines and verification methods for automated vehicle HMIs
%V 60
%P 121-136
%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369847818301748
%X In most levels of vehicle automation, drivers will not be merely occupants or passengers of automated vehicles. Especially in lower levels of automation, where the driver is still required to serve as a fallback level (SAE L3) or even as a supervisor (SAE L2), there is a need to communicate relevant system states (e.g., that the automated driving system works reliably or that there is a need for manual intervention) via the Human-Machine Interface (HMI). However, there are currently no agreed-upon guidelines that apply speciﬁcally to HMIs for automated driving. In this paper, we summarize design recommendations for visual-auditory and visual-vibrotactile HMIs derived from empirical research, applicable standards and design guidelines pertaining to in-vehicle interfaces. On this basis, we derive an initial set of principles and criteria for guiding the development and design of automated vehicle HMIs. A heuristic evaluation methodology consisting of an itemized checklist evaluation that can be used to verify that basic HMI requirements formulated in the guidelines are met is also presented. The heuristic evaluation involves an inspection of the HMI during typical use cases, judging their compliance with the proposed guidelines and documentation of identiﬁed instances of non-compliance. Taken together, the combination of the proposed guidelines and the heuristic evaluation methodology form the basis for both design and validation recommendations of automated vehicle HMIs, that can serve the industry in the important evolution of automation within vehicles.

%V 74

%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369847820304848
%X Ambiguous situations in trafﬁc often require communication and cooperation between road users. In order to resolve these situations and increase cooperative driving behavior in situations of merging or turning left, manual drivers could be assisted by an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) for cooperative driving. This simulator study investigated the behavior of drivers confronted with system limits and failures of such a system. The ADAS used in this study informed the driver about an upcoming cooperation situation and gave advice on how to behave (e.g. reduce speed, change lane). Two test situations were implemented: a system freeze and an unexpected event, which could not be detected by the system. In order to ﬁnd the most ﬁtting HMI solution, the place of presentation (head-up display (HUD) vs. instrument cluster) as well as the form of presentation (dynamic vs. symbolic) were varied. The results indicated that the most ﬁtting HMI solution to support the driver in a complex coordinated driving situation is a dynamic HUD, mainly due to the positive effect on glance behavior. However, advantages of both forms of presentation were revealed, as each form of presentation increased the probability of recognition for one of the test situations. The fewest collisions took place with the dynamic form of presentation.

%X The study analyses the Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) of a driver assistance system for cooperative driving, such as merging or turning left situations. Three versions of the HMI are varied as independent variables within subjects. Two versions, displayed in the instrument cluster, focus either on a dynamic or a static illustration of the current status of the system. The third HMI, developed in a preliminary study, serves as benchmark to compare the cluster-based HMIs. The benchmark HMI uses the same status messages and highlights the partner directly in the environment by augmented reality elements. The results of the present study show that the Benchmark best supported cooperative behavior. Both versions of the HMI located in the instrument cluster also support cooperative behavior and are accepted by the drivers. However, more glances are shifted from the relevant area in the driving scenario towards the cluster compared to the Benchmark HMI. With the static version, the participants felt more distracted compared to the dynamic HMI. In conclusion, as long as it is not technically possible to display the partner directly in the environment, a dynamic display in cooperation situations is a good alternative.

%T Exploring drivers’ mental workload and visual demand while using an in-vehicle HMI for eco-safe driving
%V 146

%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001457520315761
%X Eco-safe driving is a promising approach to improve road safety while reducing transport emissions. The application of an eco-safe driving system is feasible with the support of vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure tech­ nologies. To guarantee system usability and safety appropriateness, a key precondition is to ensure that driver mental workload and visual demands required for using the system are reasonable. This study explored how drivers’ mental workload and visual demands were affected when driving with an eco-safe driving HMI (humanmachine-interface). Four in-vehicle eco-safe HMI information conditions were evaluated, including baseline, advice only, feedback only, and advice & feedback. Two traffic scenarios (stop-sign intersection with traffic vs. stop-sign intersection without traffic) were simulated using an advanced driving simulator. Behavioural variables (e.g. brake force, acceleration), visual variables (e.g. blink metrics, pupil size) and subjective workload scores were collected from 36 licensed Australian drivers. The experiment results showed that the HMI prompted drivers to apply a smooth and stable brake force when they approached the intersection and a smooth accel­ eration when they left the intersection. Drivers’ mental workload indicated by visual measurements were consistent with their subjective reported workload levels. Drivers had a higher mental workload when they received and processed additional eco-safe information in the advice & feedback condition. An increase in mental workload induced by the in-vehicle cognitive task initiated more blink activities while the increase in visual demand caused by a complex road situation led to blink inhibition. The study shows the HMI could significantly promote eco-safe driving behaivours without causing excessive mental and visual workload of drivers.

%T ManuChain: Combining Permissioned Blockchain With a Holistic Optimization Model as Bi-Level Intelligence for Smart Manufacturing
%V 50
%N 1
%P 182-192
%X The growth of individualized product demands drives high flexibility of manufacturing processes, which requires large-scale deployment of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Since centralized control of IIoT suffers from poor flexibility in coping with disturbances and changes, a decentralized organization structure is a better choice, in which a permissioned blockchain-driven IIoT can enable partially decentralized selforganization and thus offload and accelerate the optimization of upper-level manufacturing planning. A novel iterative bi-level hybrid intelligence model named ManuChain is proposed to get rid of unbalance/inconsistency between holistic planning and local execution in individualized manufacturing systems. Lowerlevel blockchain-driven smart contracts proactively decentralize fine-grained and individualized task execution among machine tools via Raspberry Pi-based smart gateways and make the results available on an upper-level digital twin model for iterative coarse-grained holistic optimization. A prototype ManuChain based on a permissioned blockchain network is presented to realize both lower-level crowd self-organizing intelligence and upper-level holistic optimization intelligence.

%X In order to enhance the security of network operations, establish effective security measures, prevent the destruction of security incidents, and reduce or eliminate the losses caused by threats through network risk assessment is of important practical signiﬁcance. However, most risk assessment methods focus on the research of threats and vulnerabilities. There are relatively few researches on risk based on network assets and there is a lack of accuracy in risk assessment. Therefore, this paper proposes a network risk assessment method based on asset association graphs. The method ﬁrst describes the network from the perspective of asset interconnection and builds an asset association graph; secondly, it builds a threat scenario based on the asset association graph, identiﬁes a threat event, and uses the probability of a threat event and the loss caused by the asset to obtain a quantitative description of the risk assessment; Different network risk levels and make decisions. Experiments show that the method of network risk assessment based on asset association proposed in this paper can realize the risk assessment of all assets, hosts and entire network system in the network, and provide effective guidance for network security protection.

%X Attack graphs are commonly used to analyse the security of medium-sized to large networks. Based on a scan of the network and likelihood information of vulnerabilities, attack graphs can be transformed into Bayesian Attack Graphs (BAGs). These BAGs are used to evaluate how security controls affect a network and how changes in topology affect security. A challenge with these automatically generated BAGs is that cycles arise naturally, which make it impossible to use Bayesian network theory to calculate state probabilities. In this paper we provide a systematic approach to analyse and perform computations over cyclic Bayesian attack graphs. We present an interpretation of Bayesian attack graphs based on combinational logic circuits, which facilitates an intuitively attractive systematic treatment of cycles. We prove properties of the associated logic circuit and present an algorithm that computes state probabilities without altering the attack graphs (e.g., remove an arc to remove a cycle). Moreover, our algorithm deals seamlessly with any cycle without the need to identify their type. A set of experiments demonstrates the scalability of the algorithm on computer networks with hundreds of machines, each with multiple vulnerabilities.

%X We present data from several German freeways showing diﬀerent kinds of congested traﬃc forming near road inhomogeneities, speciﬁcally lane closings, intersections, or uphill gradients. The states are localized or extended, homogeneous or oscillating. Combined states are observed as well, like the coexistence of moving localized clusters and clusters pinned at road inhomogeneities, or regions of oscillating congested traﬃc upstream of nearly homogeneous congested traﬃc. The experimental ﬁndings are consistent with a recently proposed theoretical phase diagram for traﬃc near on-ramps [D. Helbing, A. Hennecke, and M. Treiber, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 4360 (1999)]. We simulate these situations with a novel continuous microscopic single-lane model, the “intelligent driver model” (IDM), using the empirical boundary conditions. All observations, including the coexistence of states, are qualitatively reproduced by describing inhomogeneities with local variations of one model parameter. We show that the results of the microscopic model can be understood by formulating the theoretical phase diagram for bottlenecks in a more general way. In particular, a local drop of the road capacity induced by parameter variations has practically the same eﬀect as an on-ramp.

%T A Hazard Analysis Approach for the SOTIF in Intelligent Railway Driving Assistance Systems Using STPA and Complex Network

%P 7714
%U https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/16/7714
%X The Intelligent Railway Driving Assistance System (IRDAS) is a novel kind of onboard system that relies on its own situational awareness function to ensure the safety and efﬁciency of train driving. In such systems, the use of situational awareness brings about a new fault-free safety problem, i.e., the safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF). It is essential to analyze the SOTIF-related hazardous factors for ensuring a safe train operation. In this paper, a hazard analysis approach is proposed to capture and evaluate SOTIF-related hazardous factors of IRDAS. This approach consists of an extended STPA-based hazardous factor identiﬁcation part and a complex network-based hazardous factor evaluation part. In the ﬁrst part, an extended control structure of STPA is designed for the modeling of the situational awareness process, followed by a new classiﬁcation of SOTIF-related causal scenarios to assist the identiﬁcation of causal scenarios. In the second part, a modeling method for heterogeneous complex networks and some customized topological indexes are proposed to evaluate the hazardous factors identiﬁed in the STPA causal analysis. The outcomes of the approach can help develop targeted hazard control strategies. The proposed approach has been applied to a new IRDAS operating in Tsuen Wan Line of Hong Kong MTR. The result shows that the approach is effective for the analysis of hazardous factors and is helpful for the formulation of hazard control strategies.

%X Scenarios are the basis of virtual simulation and should be properly designed and created to ensure the diversity, rationality and criticality. Many researches involve the description of scenario and generation of test case. In this work, we propose a new SOTIF scenario hierarchy to depict static entities, dynamic information and relationships in the scenario. The concept of scenario potential risk is deﬁned in this paper. The prior collision probability and safety control intensity are introduced to quantize the scenario potential risk. Finally, based on the architecture of scenario, we designed a novel process to automatically generate scenarios with the genetic algorithm. The experiments carried out show that proposed methods can generate diverse and trivial test case library.

%X As a promising technology to converge the traditional industry with the digital economy, digital twin (DT) is being investigated by researchers and practitioners across many different fields. The importance of data to DT cannot be overstated. Data plays critical roles in constructing virtual models, building cyber-physical connections, and executing intelligent operations. The unique characteristics of DT put forward a set of new requirements on data. Against this background, this paper discusses the emerging requirements on DT-related data with respect to data gathering, mining, fusion, interaction, iterative optimization, universality, and on-demand usage. A new notion, namely digital twin data (DTD), is introduced. This paper explores some basic principles and methods for DTD gathering, storage, interaction, association, fusion, evolution and servitization, as well as the key enabling technologies. Based on the theoretical underpinning provided in this paper, it is expected that more DT researchers and practitioners can incorporate DTD into their DT development process.

%X The digital twin is often presented as the solution to Industry 4.0 and, while there are many areas where this may be the case, there is a risk that a reliance on existing machine learning methods will not be able to deliver the high level cognitive capabilities such as adaptability, cause and effect, and planning that Industry 4.0 requires. As the limitations of machine learning are beginning to be understood, the paradigm of strong artificial intelligence is emerging. The field of artificial cognitive systems is part of the strong artificial intelligence paradigm and is aimed at generating computational systems capable of mimicking biological systems in learning and interacting with the world. This paper presents an argument that artificial cognitive systems offer solutions to the higher level cognitive challenges of Industry 4.0 and that digital twin research should be driven in the direction of artificial cognition accordingly. This argument is based on the inherent similarities between the digital twin and artificial cognitive systems, and the insights that can already be seen in aligning the two approaches.

%T Towards Lightweight, Privacy-Preserving Cooperative Object Classification for Connected Autonomous Vehicles
%P 1-1
%U https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9468670/
%X Collaborative perception enables autonomous vehicles to exchange sensor data among each other to achieve cooperative object classiﬁcation, which is considered an effective means to improve the perception accuracy of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To protect information privacy in cooperative perception, we propose a lightweight, privacypreserving cooperative object classiﬁcation framework that allows CAVs to exchange raw sensor data (e.g., images captured by HD camera), without leaking private information. Leveraging chaotic encryption and additive secret sharing technique, image data is ﬁrst encrypted into two ciphertexts and processed, in the encrypted format, by two separate edge servers. The use of chaotic mapping can avoid information leakage during data uploading. The encrypted images are then processed by the proposed privacy-preserving convolutional neural network (PCNN) model embedded in the designed secure computing protocols. Finally, the processed results are combined/decrypted on the receiving vehicles to realize cooperative object classiﬁcation. We formally prove the correctness and security of the proposed framework and carry out intensive experiments to evaluate its performance. Experiment results indicate that P-CNN offers exactly almost the same object classiﬁcation results as the original CNN model, while offers great privacy protection of shared data and lightweight execution efﬁciency.

This paper presents a novel kind of decision of weight of multi-attribute decision-making model based on Bayesian networks. Critical technique, ‘Bayesian networks’ is used to determine value of weights, which combined prior information (other experts’ knowledge, or numerical simulation etc.) with experts’ knowledge. This method effectively takes advantage of experts’ knowledge and avoids the problem with experts’ subjectivity. An illustrative example is showed to explore the implications of proposed method.

%T Scenario-Based Test Automation for Highly Automated Vehicles: A Review and Paving the Way for Systematic Safety Assurance
%P 1-16
%X Highly Automated Vehicles (HAVs) must undergo strict safety testing before being released to the public. Mileage-based on-road testing suffers from unaffordable time costs and high safety risks. Simulated scenario-based testing has been found to be a trustworthy alternative for testing HAVs' built-in algorithms and functionalities. Test automation is typically used to generate target scenarios. This approach facilitates customized testing and avoids wasting time on simple and redundant scenarios. This study aims to review test automation methods and discuss how to accentuate their strengths rather than be trapped in their weaknesses under certain applicable conditions. According to their main purposes, we classify test automation methods into coverage-oriented, unsafe-scenario-oriented, and naturalistic-assessment-oriented categories. To further demonstrate the differences of these methods, we then design numerical experiment to compare the capabilities of seven test automation methods. Finally, we compile our observations to form a comprehensive guide for selecting test automation methods with different test requirements in mind.

%T Artificial intelligence applications in the development of autonomous vehicles: a survey
%V 7
%N 2
%P 315-329
%X The advancement of artificial intelligence ( AI ) has truly stimulated the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles ( AVs ) in the transportation industry. Fueled by big data from various sensing devices and advanced computing resources, AI has become an essential component of AVs for perceiving the surrounding environment and making appropriate decision in motion. To achieve goal of full automation ( i.e., self-driving ( , it is important to know how AI works in AV systems. Existing research have made great efforts in investigating different aspects of applying AI in AV development. However, few studies have offered the research community a thorough examination of current practices in implementing AI in AVs. Thus, this paper aims to shorten the gap by providing a comprehensive survey of key studies in this research avenue. Specifically, it intends to analyze their use of AIs in supporting the primary applications in AVs: 1) perception; 2) localization and mapping; and 3) decision making. It investigates the current practices to understand how AI can be used and what are the challenges and issues associated with their implementation. Based on the exploration of current practices and technology advances, this paper further provides insights into potential opportunities regarding the use of AI in conjunction with other emerging technologies: 1) high definition maps, big data, and high performance computing; 2) augmented reality( AR ) / virtual reality ( VR ) enhanced simulation platform; and 3) 5G communication for connected AVs. This paper is expected to offer a quick reference for researchers interested in understanding the use of AI in AV research.

%T Towards edge intelligence in the automotive scenario: A discourse on architecture for database-supported autonomous platooning
%V 24
%N 2
%P 192-208
%X Edge intelligence is one of the key paradigms related to the efficient implementation of future wireless networks. In this context, the surrounding telecommunication infrastructure is intended to support the functioning of the wireless system. Thus, it is necessary to offload some computational efforts to the system edge, allowing the infrastructure to learn and make prospective decisions. However, for the reliable realization of the edge intelligence concept, the wireless system architecture should be designed properly to minimize both storage cost and induced latency. In this paper, we compare three architecture proposals (centralized, distributed, and hybrid) tailored to the autonomous driving use case, being one of the key vertical scenarios in contemporary and future wireless networks. We evaluate the performance of an autonomous platooning system, where the operating frequency is selected dynamically with the support of infrastructure to minimize the overall interference level in the whole band. Extensive computer simulations have been carried out to analyze the impact of the induced delay in signal processing and storage efficiency.

%T What drives people to accept automated vehicles? Findings from a field experiment

%P 320-334
%U 10.1016/j.trc.2018.07.024
%X This ﬁeld study aims at understanding the inﬂuence of direct experience of an automated vehicle (AV, Level 3) and explaining and predicting public acceptance of AVs through a psychological model. The model includes behavioral intention (BI) to use self-driving vehicles (SDVs, Level 5), willingness to re-ride (WTR) in our AV (Level 3), and their four potential determinants, namely perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU), trust related to SDVs, and perceived safety (PS) while riding in our AV. The last two determinants are largely ignored, but we consider them critical in the context of AVs. Three-hundred students were invited as participants (passengers) to experience the AV. The trust, PU, PEU, and BI of the participants were recorded prior to their experiencing the AV; after this experience, all the constructs of the psychological model were recorded. The participants’ experience with the AV was found to increase their trust, PU and PEU (but not BI), the consistency between PU/PEU and BI, and the explanatory power of BI. The model explained 55% of the variance in BI and 40% in WTR. PU, trust, and PS were found to be steady and direct predictors of both the acceptance measures; PEU predicted BI only after the participants’ AV experience. Mediation analysis showed that trust also can indirectly aﬀect AV acceptance through other determinants. Out-of-sample prediction conﬁrmed the model’s predictive capability for AV acceptance. The theoretical contributions and practical implications of the ﬁndings are discussed.

%T Adaptive Potential Field-Based Path Planning for Complex Autonomous Driving Scenarios
%V 8
%P 225294-225305
%X An adaptive potential field is designed to adapt the acceleration/deceleration and mass of the obstacle. The potential fields are established in a transformed road coordinate system to improve the feasibility and robustness. A path planning method is proposed based on the designed adaptive potential field to improve the driving safety and the ride comfort of autonomous vehicles in complex driving scenarios, which including the cut-in, emergency braking, obstacle sudden accelerating during overtaking and the curve road driving scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by simulations with constructed and real data, respectively. The TTC\texts (Time-to-Collision) and the maximum lateral accelerations are used to evaluate the improvements on safety and ride comfort. The results show that both the driving safety and ride comfort are efficiently improved by using the proposed approach in emergency braking and accelerating scenarios. Meanwhile, the proposed method can be well applied in a curve road driving environment.

%X Wireless sensor nodes are usually powered by batteries that have limited energy capacity. In many applications, the nodes are installed in inaccessible locations where they are problematic to replace or recharge. Therefore, energy optimization is crucial for increasing the node’s lifetime. This study presents a method for the analysis and prediction of the energy consumption of Sigfox-based wireless sensor nodes. The method is illustrated in a use case where the nodes monitor the water level in drainage lines in cities to improve surface and wastewater management. We propose a formal model-based technique using the UPPAAL statistical model checker tool to model and analyze the node’s lifetime. Statistical model checking (SMC) provides a highly scalable technique for the performance analysis of complex cyber-physical systems. The model captures the energy-related behavior of the node, the Sigfox radio specification, and the sensor, each parameterized with values from the device’s datasheets. Furthermore, we calibrate the model using measurements obtained from real-world hardware. Finally, we evaluate a collection of strategies to optimize the battery lifetime of the node. We simulate the model with a 10 000-mAh battery, and the results indicate that we can extend the node’s lifetime from 202 days to 2.71 years using our most optimized transmission strategy.

%T Effects of explanation types and perceived risk on trust in autonomous vehicles
%V 73
%P 271-280
%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369847820304587
%X Despite technological advances, trust still remains as a major issue facing autonomous vehicles. Existing studies have reported that explanations of the status of automation systems can be an effective strategy to increase trust, but these effects can differ depending on the forms of explanations and autonomous driving situations. To address this issue, this study examines the effects of explanation types and perceived risk on trust in autonomous vehicles. Three types of explanations (i.e., no, simple, and attributional explanations) are designed based on attribution theory. Additionally, four autonomous driving situations with different levels of risk are designed based on a simulator program. Results show that explanation type signiﬁcantly affects trust in autonomous vehicles, and the perceived risk of driving situations signiﬁcantly moderates the effect of the explanation type. At a high level of perceived risk, attributional explanations and no explanations lead to the lowest and highest values in trust, respectively. However, at a low level of perceived risk, these effects reverse.

%T Driver-TRN: An Approach to Driver Behavior Detection Enhanced SOTIF in Automated Vehicles
%* All rights reserved
%X Detecting and understanding driver behaviors in automated vehicles are critical for reducing the risk of misuse and ensuring the Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF). Using a Temporal Recurrent Network (TRN), the paper proposes the driver-TRN model to detect and predict driver behaviors based on real-time vehicular data, such as in-car video, road camera, and sensor data, which addresses intended risks resulting from the interaction between drivers and automated systems that may be overlooked. This paper improves the performance of the driver-TRN with multiple data sources and multi-task loss finetuning. The experiments based on the Brain4Cars dataset show that the driver-TRN can enhance the safety and reliability of automated vehicles by providing a more comprehensive detection of driver behaviors.

%X Safety of the intended functionality is an indispensable safe condition that must be considered for autonomous driving on the road. The key to study SOTIF is to construct as many hazardous scenarios as possible and accurately assess SOTIF. It is difﬁcult to test many automated driving vehicles in the current research and discover all the unknown triggering events in the intended functionality. As a new simulation method, vehicle digital twins can simulate as many driving scenarios as possible efﬁciently and at a low cost in a short time. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm to assess SOTIF with unknown hazards based on the vehicle digital twins based on a Bayesian hazard graph with attributes and Noisy-OR structures. This paper uses CARLA to build the vehicle digital twins and testing this algorithm based on these digital twins. After testing, the SOTIF quantitative assessment algorithm proposed in this paper is effective and has good performance.

%T An Unknown Risk Analysis and Evaluation Method for Distribution Edge Computing Networks
%X Distribution edge computing networks have strong risk analysis and evaluation requirements for unknown attack. To effectively identify these potential attacks for unknown risk evaluation, this work focuses on an unknown risk analysis based on the Bayesian hazard graph. In this work, we propose a Bayesian hazard graph-based algorithm considering the context of edge computing networks. The risk assessment method is established for calculating unknown risks according to the noise model. The algorithm combines the CVSS scoring standard to generate the conditional probability table. This algorithm leverages known information and real-time feedback to continuously update probability distributions. It is suitable for applying this algorithm for the distribution edge computing networks.

%T Spatial Transformer Networks
%X Convolutional Neural Networks deﬁne an exceptionally powerful class of models, but are still limited by the lack of ability to be spatially invariant to the input data in a computationally and parameter efﬁcient manner. In this work we introduce a new learnable module, the Spatial Transformer, which explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network. This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modiﬁcation to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.

%T Exploring Recurrent Long-term Temporal Fusion for Multi-view 3D Perception
%I arXiv
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05970
%X Long-term temporal fusion is a crucial but often overlooked technique in camera-based Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) 3D perception. Existing methods are mostly in a parallel manner. While parallel fusion can beneﬁt from long-term information, it suffers from increasing computational and memory overheads as the fusion window size grows. Alternatively, BEVFormer adopts a recurrent fusion pipeline so that history information can be efﬁciently integrated, yet it fails to beneﬁt from longer temporal frames. In this paper, we explore an embarrassingly simple long-term recurrent fusion strategy built upon the LSS-based methods and ﬁnd it already able to enjoy the merits from both sides, i.e., rich long-term information and efﬁcient fusion pipeline. A temporal embedding module is further proposed to improve the model’s robustness against occasionally missed frames in practical scenarios. We name this simple but effective fusing pipeline VideoBEV. Experimental results on the nuScenes benchmark show that VideoBEV obtains leading performance on various camera-based 3D perception tasks, including object detection (55.4% mAP and 62.9% NDS), segmentation (48.6% vehicle mIoU), tracking (54.8% AMOTA), and motion prediction (0.80m minADE and 0.463 EPA). Code will be available.

%T AV-FUZZER: Finding Safety Violations in Autonomous Driving Systems

%@ 978-1-72819-870-5
%U https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9251068/
%X This paper proposes AV-FUZZER, a testing framework, to ﬁnd the safety violations of an autonomous vehicle (AV) in the presence of an evolving trafﬁc environment. We perturb the driving maneuvers of trafﬁc participants to create situations in which an AV can run into safety violations. To optimally search for the perturbations to be introduced, we leverage domain knowledge of vehicle dynamics and genetic algorithm to minimize the safety potential of an AV over its projected trajectory. The values of the perturbation determined by this process provide parameters that deﬁne participants’ trajectories. To improve the efﬁciency of the search, we design a local fuzzer that increases the exploitation of local optima in the areas where highly likely safetyhazardous situations are observed. By repeating the optimization with signiﬁcantly different starting points in the search space, AV-FUZZER determines several diverse AV safety violations. We demonstrate AV-FUZZER on an industrial-grade AV platform, Baidu Apollo, and ﬁnd ﬁve distinct types of safety violations in a short period of time. In comparison, other existing techniques can ﬁnd at most two. We analyze the safety violations found in Apollo and discuss their overarching causes.

%T RED: Reinforced Encoder-Decoder Networks for Action Anticipation
%I arXiv
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04818
%X Action anticipation aims to detect an action before it happens. Many real world applications in robotics and surveillance are related to this predictive capability. Current methods address this problem by ﬁrst anticipating visual representations of future frames and then categorizing the anticipated representations to actions. However, anticipation is based on a single past frame’s representation, which ignores the history trend. Besides, it can only anticipate a ﬁxed future time. We propose a Reinforced Encoder-Decoder (RED) network for action anticipation. RED takes multiple history representations as input and learns to anticipate a sequence of future representations. One salient aspect of RED is that a reinforcement module is adopted to provide sequence-level supervision; the reward function is designed to encourage the system to make correct predictions as early as possible. We test RED on TVSeries, THUMOS-14 and TV-Human-Interaction datasets for action anticipation and achieve state-of-the-art performance on all datasets.

%T Learning to Discriminate Information for Online Action Detection: Analysis and Application
%P 1-17
%U https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9881239/
%X Online action detection, which aims to identify an ongoing action from a streaming video, is an important subject in realworld applications. For this task, previous methods use recurrent neural networks for modeling temporal relations in an input sequence. However, these methods overlook the fact that the input image sequence includes not only the action of interest but background and irrelevant actions. This would induce recurrent units to accumulate unnecessary information for encoding features on the action of interest. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel recurrent unit, named Information Discrimination Unit (IDU), which explicitly discriminates the information relevancy between an ongoing action and others to decide whether to accumulate the input information. This enables learning more discriminative representations for identifying an ongoing action. In this paper, we further present a new recurrent unit, called Information Integration Unit (IIU), for action anticipation. Our IIU exploits the outputs from IDN as pseudo action labels as well as RGB frames to learn enriched features of observed actions effectively. In experiments on TVSeries and THUMOS-14, the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods by a signiﬁcant margin in online action detection and action anticipation. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed units by conducting comprehensive ablation studies.

%T A Test Scenario Automatic Generation Strategy for Intelligent Driving Systems
%V 2019
%P 1-10
%U https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2019/3737486/
%X In this paper, a methodology of automatic generation of test scenarios for intelligent driving systems is proposed, which is based on the combination of the test matrix (TM) and combinatorial testing (CT) methods together. With a hierarchical model of influence factors, an evaluation index for scenario complexity is designed. Then an improved CT algorithm is proposed to make a balance between test efficiency, condition coverage, and scenario complexity. This method can ensure the required combinational coverage and at the same time increase the overall complexity of generated scenarios, which is not considered by CT. Furthermore, the way to find the best compromise between efficiency and complexity and the bound of scenario number has been analyzed theoretically. To validate the effectiveness, it has been applied in the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test of a lane departure warning system (LDW). The results show that the proposed method can ensure required coverage with a significantly improved scenario complexity, and the generated test scenario can find system defects more efficiently.

%T Research on the Complexity Quantification Method of Driving Scenarios Based on Information Entropy
%P 3476-3481
%X Automated driving system (ADS) is the crucial part of the autonomous vehicle (AV). However, an ADS might be involved in a scenario with high uncertainty, which is mainly derived from dynamic traffic participants. The quantification of scenario complexity can both enhance the environmental cognition and accelerate the testing and validation work of an AV. In this paper, a quantification method of scenario complexity is proposed. Firstly, scenario complexity is defined as the measurement of the uncertainties of all dynamic entities. As the moving vehicles are viewed as random variables, information entropy is introduced to represent the uncertainties of dynamic entities. Secondly, the drivable area has been brought up to compute the entropy of each vehicle in the scenario by using a search-based trajectory cluster generation algorithm. Then, the scenario complexity is evaluated by combining the entropies of all dynamic entities. In the end, several applications are illustrated to show that the proposed method has a broad adaptability to different driving scenarios and can effectively estimate the change of complexity of complicated scenarios such as intersection in real-time.

Design/methodology/approach – The author adopted the index F1 to quantitative critical-scenarios’ coverage of the search space and proposed the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) to enhance exploration ability for higher coverage. Compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO), there were three improvements. In the initial phase, the Latin hypercube sampling method was introduced for a uniform distribution of particles. In the iteration phase, the neighborhood operator was adapted to explore more modals with the particles divided into groups. In the convergence phase, the convergence judgment and restart strategy were used to explore the search space by avoiding local convergence. Compared with the Monte Carlo method (MC) and PSO, experiments on the artiﬁcial function and critical-scenarios search were carried out to verify the efﬁciency and the application effect of the method.

%T BYOLMed3D: Self-Supervised Representation Learning of Medical Videos using Gradient Accumulation Assisted 3D BYOL Framework
%I arXiv
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00444
%X Applications on Medical Image Analysis suffer from acute shortage of large volume of data properly annotated by medical experts. Supervised Learning algorithms require a large volumes of balanced data to learn robust representations. Often supervised learning algorithms require various techniques to deal with imbalanced data. Self-supervised learning algorithms on the other hand are robust to imbalance in the data and are capable of learning robust representations. In this work, we train a 3D BYOL self-supervised model using gradient accumulation technique to deal with the large number of samples in a batch generally required in a self-supervised algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the ﬁrst of its kind in this domain. We compare the results obtained through our experiments in the downstream task of ACL Tear Injury detection with the contemporary self-supervised pre-training methods and also with ResNet3D-18 initialized with the Kinetics-400 pre-trained weights. From the downstream task experiments, it is evident that the proposed framework outperforms the existing baselines.

%* arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license
%U https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06553
%X Self-supervised representation learning is able to learn semantically meaningful features; however, much of its recent success relies on multiple crops of an image with very few objects. Instead of learning view-invariant representation from simple images, humans learn representations in a complex world with changing scenes by observing object movement, deformation, pose variation, and ego motion. Motivated by this ability, we present a new self-supervised learning representation framework that can be directly deployed on a video stream of complex scenes with many moving objects. Our framework features a simple flow equivariance objective that encourages the network to predict the features of another frame by applying a flow transformation to the features of the current frame. Our representations, learned from high-resolution raw video, can be readily used for downstream tasks on static images. Readout experiments on challenging semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection benchmarks show that we are able to outperform representations obtained from previous state-of-the-art methods including SimCLR and BYOL.

%T Coarse Temporal Attention Network (CTA-Net) for Driver’s Activity Recognition
%P 1278-1288
%X There is significant progress in recognizing traditional human activities from videos focusing on highly distinctive actions involving discriminative body movements, body-object and/or human-human interactions. Driver's activities are different since they are executed by the same subject with similar body parts movements, resulting in subtle changes. To address this, we propose a novel framework by exploiting the spatiotemporal attention to model the subtle changes. Our model is named Coarse Temporal Attention Network (CTA-Net), in which coarse temporal branches are introduced in a trainable glimpse network. The goal is to allow the glimpse to capture high-level temporal relationships, such as `during', `before' and `after' by focusing on a specific part of a video. These branches also respect the topology of the temporal dynamics in the video, ensuring that different branches learn meaningful spatial and temporal changes. The model then uses an innovative attention mechanism to generate high-level action specific contextual information for activity recognition by exploring the hidden states of an LSTM. The attention mechanism helps in learning to decide the importance of each hidden state for the recognition task by weighing them when constructing the representation of the video. Our approach is evaluated on four publicly accessible datasets and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by a considerable margin with only RGB video as input.

%T Keeping the driver in the loop in conditionally automated driving: A perception-action theory approach
%V 79
%P 49-62
%X Abstract   In this paper we investigated if keeping the driver in the perception–action loop during automated driving can improve take-over behavior from conditionally automated driving. To meet this aim, we designed an experiment in which visual exposure (perception) and manual control exposure (action) were manipulated. In a dynamic driving simulator experiment, participants (n=88) performed a non-driving related task either in a head-up display in the windshield (high visual exposure) or on a head-down display near the gear shift (low visual exposure). While driving, participants were either in an intermittent control-mode with four noncritical take-over situations (high manual control exposure), or in a continuous automation-mode throughout the ride (low manual control exposure). In all conditions, a critical take-over had to be carried out after an approximately 13min ride. Measurements of take-over behavior showed that only high visual exposure had an effect on hands-on reaction time measurements. Both visual exposure and manual control exposure had small to medium sized main effects on time to system deactivation, the maximum velocity of the steering wheel, and the standard deviation of the steering wheel angle. The combined high visual – and high manual control exposure condition led to 0.55s faster reaction time and 37% less steering variability in comparison to the worst case low visual – and low manual control exposure condition. Together, results corroborate that maintaining visual exposure and manual control exposure during automated driving can be efficacious and suggest that their positive effects are additive.

%T Multisource Adaption for Driver Attention Prediction in Arbitrary Driving Scenes
%V 23
%N 11
%P 20912-20925
%X Driver attention cues contribute to the following intended maneuver prediction and provide a risk indicator for the advanced driver-assistance systems in complex driving scenarios. The diverse traffic scenes result in a challenging task to predict human visual attention with high generalization capability. The data heterogeneity caused by multiple sources with different data characteristics, such as video sources, was investigated in the current research and mitigated using the domain adaption modules (i.e., domain-specific batch normalization, Gaussian priors, and smoothing filter) and the domain-specific focal loss. Inspired by human attention mechanism, generic coders and task-driven attention modules were incorporated into a lightweight network to replicate human-like perceptual patterns, such as the perception of latent risk. Integrating these adaptive modules, we proposed the adaptive driver attention (ADA) model to predict salient regions in different traffic scenes. Consequently, the ADA model trained jointly on four driver attention datasets achieves the best performance against the state-of-the-art methods across seven metrics. Retrospective visualizations of the network and cross-validation results further explain the merit of the proposed method. Since these approaches are generic, adaptive modules are universally applicable for standard deep neural network architectures to alleviate the heterogeneity across datasets and easily extended for arbitrary traffic scenes in the real world.

%T MEDIRL: Predicting the Visual Attention of Drivers via Maximum Entropy Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning
%X Inspired by human visual attention, we introduce a Maximum Entropy Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MEDIRL) framework for modeling the visual attention allocation of drivers in imminent rear-end collisions. MEDIRL is composed of visual, driving, and attention modules. Given a front-view driving video and corresponding eye fixations from humans, the visual and driving modules extract generic and driving-specific visual features, respectively. Finally, the attention module learns the intrinsic task-sensitive reward functions induced by eye fixation policies recorded from attentive drivers. MEDIRL uses the learned policies to predict visual attention allocation of drivers. We also introduce EyeCar, a new driver visual attention dataset during accident-prone situations. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that MEDIRL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on driving task-related visual attention allocation on the following large-scale driving attention benchmark datasets: DR(eye)VE, BDD-A, and DADA-2000. The code and dataset are provided for reproducibility.

%T DeepTake: Prediction of Driver Takeover Behavior using Multimodal Data
%X Automated vehicles promise a future where drivers can engage in non-driving tasks without hands on the steering wheels for a prolonged period. Nevertheless, automated vehicles may still need to occasionally hand the control back to drivers due to technology limitations and legal requirements. While some systems determine the need for driver takeover using driver context and road condition to initiate a takeover request, studies show that the driver may not react to it. We present DeepTake, a novel deep neural network-based framework that predicts multiple aspects of takeover behavior to ensure that the driver is able to safely take over the control when engaged in non-driving tasks. Using features from vehicle data, driver biometrics, and subjective measurements, DeepTake predicts the driver's intention, time, and quality of takeover. We evaluate DeepTake performance using multiple evaluation metrics. Results show that DeepTake reliably predicts the takeover intention, time, and quality, with an accuracy of 96%, 93%, and 83%, respectively. Results also indicate that DeepTake outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on predicting driver takeover time and quality. Our findings have implications for the algorithm development of driver monitoring and state detection.

%T Self-report measures for the assessment of human–machine interfaces in automated driving
%V 22
%N 4
%P 703-720
%X For a successful market introduction of Level 3 Automated Driving Systems (L3 ADS), a careful evaluation of human–machine interfaces (HMIs) is necessary. User preference has often focused on usability, user experience, acceptance and trust. However, a thorough evaluation of measures when applied to ADS HMIs is missing. We investigated the appropriateness of nine self-reported measures in terms of reliability and validity. A sample of N=57 participants completed two 15-min simulator drives with a L3 ADS. They experienced two variations of a HMI that differed in the degree of complying with common guidelines. Consistency analysis identified scales that showed insufficient reliability. Validity examination revealed a three-factorial structure of self-reports for construct validity. These factors are design-orientation, usability-orientation and acceptance-orientation. All measures were sensitive to the HMI manipulation and therefore exhibited criterion-related validity. The present study provides researchers and practitioners in the area of ADS with a recommendation for self-report measure application.

%T Determinants of take-over time from automated driving : A meta-analysis of 129 studies
%V 64
%P 285-307
%X An important question in automated driving research is how quickly drivers take over control of the vehicle in response to a critical event or a take-over request. Although a large number of studies have been performed, results vary strongly. In this study, we investigated mean take-over times from 129 studies with SAE level 2 automation or higher. We used three complementary approaches: (1) a within-study analysis, in which differences in mean take-over time were assessed for pairs of experimental conditions, (2) a between-study analysis, in which correlations between experimental conditions and mean take-over times were assessed, and (3) a linear mixed-effects model combining between-study and within-study effects. The three methods showed that a shorter mean take-over time is associated with a higher urgency of the situation, not using a handheld device, not performing a visual non-driving task, having experienced another take-over scenario before in the experiment, and receiving an auditory or vibrotactile take-over request as compared to a visual-only or no take-over request. A consistent effect of age was not observed. We also found the mean and standard deviation of the take-over time were highly correlated, indicating that the mean is predictive of variability. Our findings point to directions for new research, in particular concerning the distinction between drivers’ ability and motivation to take over, and the roles of urgency and prior experience. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

%T Predicting the Driver's Focus of Attention: The DR(eye)VE Project
%V 41
%N 7
%P 1720-1733
%X In this work we aim to predict the driver's focus of attention. The goal is to estimate what a person would pay attention to while driving, and which part of the scene around the vehicle is more critical for the task. To this end we propose a new computer vision model based on a multi-branch deep architecture that integrates three sources of information: raw video, motion and scene semantics. We also introduce DR(eye)VE, the largest dataset of driving scenes for which eye-tracking annotations are available. This dataset features more than 500,000 registered frames, matching ego-centric views (from glasses worn by drivers) and car-centric views (from roof-mounted camera), further enriched by other sensors measurements. Results highlight that several attention patterns are shared across drivers and can be reproduced to some extent. The indication of which elements in the scene are likely to capture the driver's attention may benefit several applications in the context of human-vehicle interaction and driver attention analysis.

%T Toward Driving Scene Understanding: A Dataset for Learning Driver Behavior and Causal Reasoning
%P 7699-7707
%X Driving Scene understanding is a key ingredient for intelligent transportation systems. To achieve systems that can operate in a complex physical and social environment, they need to understand and learn how humans drive and interact with traffic scenes. We present the Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD), a challenging dataset to enable research on learning driver behavior in real-life environments. The dataset includes 104 hours of real human driving in the San Francisco Bay Area collected using an instrumented vehicle equipped with different sensors. We provide a detailed analysis of HDD with a comparison to other driving datasets. A novel annotation methodology is introduced to enable research on driver behavior understanding from untrimmed data sequences. As the first step, baseline algorithms for driver behavior detection are trained and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed task.

%T Temporal Recurrent Networks for Online Action Detection
%I arXiv
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07391
%X Most work on temporal action detection is formulated as an ofﬂine problem, in which the start and end times of actions are determined after the entire video is fully observed. However, important real-time applications including surveillance and driver assistance systems require identifying actions as soon as each video frame arrives, based only on current and historical observations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Temporal Recurrent Network (TRN), to model greater temporal context of a video frame by simultaneously performing online action detection and anticipation of the immediate future. At each moment in time, our approach makes use of both accumulated historical evidence and predicted future information to better recognize the action that is currently occurring, and integrates both of these into a uniﬁed end-to-end architecture. We evaluate our approach on two popular online action detection datasets, HDD and TVSeries, as well as another widely used dataset, THUMOS’14. The results show that TRN signiﬁcantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.

%T Bootstrap your own latent: A new approach to self-supervised Learning
%I arXiv
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733
%X We introduce Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL), a new approach to self-supervised image representation learning. BYOL relies on two neural networks, referred to as online and target networks, that interact and learn from each other. From an augmented view of an image, we train the online network to predict the target network representation of the same image under a different augmented view. At the same time, we update the target network with a slow-moving average of the online network. While state-of-the art methods rely on negative pairs, BYOL achieves a new state of the art without them. BYOL reaches $74.3\%$ top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet using a linear evaluation with a ResNet-50 architecture and $79.6\%$ with a larger ResNet. We show that BYOL performs on par or better than the current state of the art on both transfer and semi-supervised benchmarks. Our implementation and pretrained models are given on GitHub.

%T Abnormal Event Detection Using Deep Contrastive Learning for Intelligent Video Surveillance System
%V 18
%N 8
%P 5171-5179
%X The continuous developments of urban and industrial environments have increased the demand for intelligent video surveillance. Deep learning has achieved remarkable performance for anomaly detection in surveillance videos. Previous approaches achieve anomaly detection with a single-pretext task (image reconstruction or prediction) and detect anomalies by larger reconstruction error or poor prediction. However, they cannot fully exploit the discriminative semantics and temporal context information. Moreover, tackling anomaly detection with a single pretext task is suboptimal due to the nonalignment between the pretext task and anomaly detection. In this article, we propose a temporal-aware contrastive network (TAC-Net) to address the abovementioned problems of anomaly detection for intelligence video surveillance. TAC-Net is an unsupervised method that utilizes deep contrastive self-supervised learning to capture the high-level semantic features and tackles anomaly detection with multiple self-supervised tasks. During inference phase, the multiple task losses and contrastive similarity are utilized to calculate the anomaly score. Experimental results show that our method is superior to state-of-the-art approaches on three benchmarks, which demonstrates the validity and advancement of TAC-Net.

%T Virtual Testing of Automated Driving Systems. A Survey on Validation Methods
%V 10
%P 24349-24367
%X This paper surveys the state-of-the-art contributions supporting the validation of virtual testing toolchains for Automated Driving System (ADS) verification. The work builds upon the well-known limitations of physical testing while conceiving the virtual counterpart as a fundamental ingredient for the type-approval of high automation level ADS. The purpose of the research effort is to summarize computational tools, validation methodologies, and the corresponding fidelity levels delivered by state-of-the-art simulation toolchains. The ultimate goal is to establish how effectively simulation can play the role of a “virtual proving ground” for ADS certification independently from any specific ADS implementation/effectiveness. The contribution includes classic high-level validation approaches and modern specific computational tools that can be adopted depending on the type of data under analysis. Moreover, the investigation covers approaches embraced both within the scientific community and in technical regulations for the sake of completeness. Ultimately, we identified two high-level validation schema: integrated environment and subsystem-based solutions. In addition, we found that modeling and validating virtual sensors for ADS is the most lacking area from a subsystem-level approach. On the other side, the closed-loop interaction between the ADS and other virtual traffic participants makes it difficult to directly compare the experimental results with simulated generated evidence as the emergent behaviors of the ADS may amplify minor discrepancies between the environments.

%T Social Coordination and Altruism in Autonomous Driving
%P 1-14
%X Despite the advances in the autonomous driving domain, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are still inefficient and limited in terms of cooperating with each other or coordinating with vehicles operated by humans. A group of autonomous and human-driven vehicles (HVs) which work together to optimize an altruistic social utility can co-exist seamlessly and assure safety and efficiency on the road. Achieving this mission without explicit coordination among agents is challenging, mainly due to the difficulty of predicting the behavior of humans with heterogeneous preferences in mixed-autonomy environments. Formally, we model an AV’s maneuver planning in mixed-autonomy traffic as a partially-observable stochastic game and attempt to derive optimal policies that lead to socially-desirable outcomes using a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework (MARL), and propose a semi-sequential multi-agent training and policy dissemination algorithm for our MARL problem. We introduce a quantitative representation of the AVs’ social preferences and design a distributed reward structure that induces altruism into their decision-making process. Altruistic AVs are able to form alliances, guide the traffic, and affect the behavior of the HVs to handle competitive driving scenarios. We compare egoistic AVs to our altruistic autonomous agents in a highway merging setting and demonstrate the emerging behaviors that lead to improvement in the number of successful merges and the overall traffic flow and safety.

%X The cybersecurity of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is an important emerging area of research in trafﬁc safety. Because human failure is the most common reason for a successful cyberattack, human-factor researchers and psychologists might improve AV cybersecurity by researching how to decrease the probability of a successful attack. We review some areas of research connected to the human factor in cybersecurity and ﬁnd many potential issues. Psychologists might research the characteristics of people prone to cybersecurity failure, the types of scenarios they fail in and the factors that inﬂuence this failure or over-trust of AV. Human behavior during a cyberattack might be researched, as well as how to educate people about cybersecurity. Multitasking has an effect on the ability to defend against a cyberattack and research is needed to set the appropriate policy. Human-resource researchers might investigate the skills required for personnel working in AV cybersecurity and how to detect potential defectors early. The psychological proﬁle of cyber attackers should be investigated to be able to set policies to decrease their motivation. Finally, the decrease of driver’s driving skills as a result of using AV and its connection to cybersecurity skills is also worth of research.

%T A Framework for Qualitative and Quantitative Formal Model-Based Safety Analysis
%P 132-141
%X In model-based safety analysis both qualitative aspects i.e. what must go wrong for a system failure) and quantitative aspects (i.e. how probable is a system failure) are very important. For both aspects methods and tools are available. However, until now for each aspect new and independent models must be built for analysis. This paper proposes the SAML framework as a formal foundation for both qualitative and quantitative formal model-based safety analysis. The main advantage of SAML is the combination of qualitative and quantitative formal semantics which allows different analyses on the same model. This increases the confidence in the analysis results, simplifies modeling and is less error-prone. The SAML framework is tool-independent. As proof-of-concept, we present sound transformation of the formalism into two state of the art model-checking notations. Prototypical tool support for the sound transformation of SAML into PRISM and MRMC for probabilistic analysis as well as different variants of the SMV model checker for qualitative analysis is currently being developed.

%X Autonomous vehicle (AV) is regarded as the ultimate solution to future automotive engineering; however, safety still remains the key challenge for the development and commercialization of the AVs. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the development status of AVs and reported accidents is becoming urgent. In this article, the levels of automation are reviewed according to the role of the automated system in the autonomous driving process, which will affect the frequency of the disengagements and accidents when driving in autonomous modes. Additionally, the public on-road AV accident reports are statistically analyzed. The results show that over 3.7 million miles have been tested for AVs by various manufacturers from 2014 to 2018. The AVs are frequently taken over by drivers if they deem necessary, and the disengagement frequency varies significantly from 2 × 10−4 to 3 disengagements per mile for different manufacturers. In addition, 128 accidents in 2014–2018 are studied, and about 63% of the total accidents are caused in autonomous mode. A small fraction of the total accidents (∼6%) is directly related to the AVs, while 94% of the accidents are passively initiated by the other parties, including pedestrians, cyclists, motorcycles, and conventional vehicles. These safety risks identified during on-road testing, represented by disengagements and actual accidents, indicate that the passive accidents which are caused by other road users are the majority. The capability of AVs to alert and avoid safety risks caused by the other parties and to make safe decisions to prevent possible fatal accidents would significantly improve the safety of AVs. Practical applications. This literature review summarizes the safety-related issues for AVs by theoretical analysis of the AV systems and statistical investigation of the disengagement and accident reports for on-road testing, and the findings will help inform future research efforts for AV developments.

%X In the development of autonomous vehicles, the main focus of sensor research has been in relation to environmental perception, and only minimal work has focused on the human-vehicle interaction perspective. However, human factors need to be considered to ensure the safe operation of partially autonomous vehicles. This study briefly introduces a design methodology for the takeover request (TOR) time in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Level 3 vehicles and compares four different TORs in a simulated environment based on human-in-the-loop experiments with various driving scenarios. A total of 30 drivers participated in the study, and the quantitative/qualitative data obtained show statistically significant differences between the four TOR thresholds. This study shows that the timing involved in the takeover can be obtained by using a performance-based approach considering human factors.

%X Driving on roads is restricted by various traffic rules, aiming to ensure safety for all traffic participants. However, human road users usually do not adhere to these rules strictly, resulting in varying degrees of rule conformity. Such deviations from given rules are key components of today's road traffic. In autonomous driving, robotic agents can disturb traffic flow, when rule deviations are not taken into account. In this paper, we present an approach to derive the distribution of degrees of rule conformity from human driving data. We demonstrate our method with the Waymo Open Motion dataset and Safety Distance and Speed Limit rules.

%X With the increasing number of electrical and electronic systems in automobiles, safety issues are particularly important. Safety of the intended functionality is an important part of it, and it solves the safety risks caused by avoiding intended functions. This paper takes the active obstacle avoidance function of the autonomous driving truck as an example, through the STPA analysis method, analyzes the intended functional safety requirements corresponding to the front-view camera, and lays the foundation for the subsequent validation and verification of the requirements.

%X The Intelligent Railway Driving Assistance System (IRDAS) is a novel kind of onboard system that relies on its own situational awareness function to ensure the safety and efficiency of train driving. In such systems, the use of situational awareness brings about a new fault-free safety problem, i.e., the safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF). It is essential to analyze the SOTIF-related hazardous factors for ensuring a safe train operation. In this paper, a hazard analysis approach is proposed to capture and evaluate SOTIF-related hazardous factors of IRDAS. This approach consists of an extended STPA-based hazardous factor identification part and a complex network-based hazardous factor evaluation part. In the first part, an extended control structure of STPA is designed for the modeling of the situational awareness process, followed by a new classification of SOTIF-related causal scenarios to assist the identification of causal scenarios. In the second part, a modeling method for heterogeneous complex networks and some customized topological indexes are proposed to evaluate the hazardous factors identified in the STPA causal analysis. The outcomes of the approach can help develop targeted hazard control strategies. The proposed approach has been applied to a new IRDAS operating in Tsuen Wan Line of Hong Kong MTR. The result shows that the approach is effective for the analysis of hazardous factors and is helpful for the formulation of hazard control strategies.

%T Liability, Ethics, and Culture-Aware Behavior Specification using Rulebooks
%P 8536-8542
%X The behavior of self-driving cars must be compatible with an enormous set of conflicting and ambiguous objectives, from law, from ethics, from the local culture, and so on. This paper describes a new way to conveniently define the desired behavior for autonomous agents, which we use on the self-driving cars developed at nuTonomy, an Aptiv company. We define a “rulebook” as a pre-ordered set of “rules”, each akin to a violation metric on the possible outcomes (“realizations”). The rules are partially ordered by priority. The semantics of a rulebook imposes a pre-order on the set of realizations. We study the compositional properties of the rulebooks, and we derive which operations we can allow on the rulebooks to preserve previously-introduced constraints. While we demonstrate the application of these techniques in the self-driving domain, the methods are domain-independent.

%T Safety of the Intended Driving Behavior Using Rulebooks
%P 136-143
%X Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are complex systems that drive in uncertain environments and potentially navigate unforeseeable situations. Safety of these systems requires not only an absence of malfunctions but also high performance of functions in many different scenarios. The ISO/PAS 21448 [1] guidance recommends a process to ensure the Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) for road vehicles. This process starts with a functional specification that fully describes the intended functionality and further includes the verification and validation that the AV meets this specification. For the path planning function, defining the correct sequence of control actions for each vehicle in all potential driving situations is intractable. In this paper, the authors provide a link between the Rulebooks framework, presented by [2], and the SOTIF process. We establish that Rulebooks provide a functional description of the path planning task in an AV and discuss the potential usage of the method for verification and validation.

%T Driver Identification Through Formal Methods
%V 23
%N 6
%P 5625-5637
%X Recently, several research efforts have been focused on automotive safety, due to the increasing technology embedded in our vehicles. Research community have produced different methods aimed, for instance, to profile driver behaviour, starting from a feature set gathered by the vehicle. The provided methods are mainly machine learning-based: these solutions, as largely demonstrate in literature, suffer from several issues, due to the context variability but also because they are not able to provide a rational reason for the specific prediction. To overcome these limitations, in this paper we propose a novel model checking based approach to driver identification. Furthermore, a novel automatic procedure able to infer a logical representation of the driver behaviour is discussed. Two real-world datasets for the evaluation of the proposed method are considered, obtaining interesting results in driver identification.

%T Driver models for the definition of safety requirements of automated vehicles in international regulations. Application to motorway driving conditions
%V 174
%P 106743
%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001457522001798
%X UN Regulation 157, the first global regulation regarding the type-approval of Automated Driving Systems (ADS), has been adopted in 2021. In it, safety performance requirements are being defined for vehicles of automation Level 3, according to the SAE J3016, with a limited Operational Design Domain (ODD). In particular, for three types of events that are related to motorway driving, two models are provided to distinguish between pre­ ventable traffic scenarios, for which the ADS is expected to avoid an accident, and unpreventable traffic sce­ narios, for which accidents cannot be avoided and the ADS can only mitigate their severity. The models recreate the short-term behavior of a driver who reacts to an emergency. Two possible actions are predicted: either no reaction or full braking when danger is identified. In the present paper the two models are analyzed and compared with two additional models: an industry proposed model, the Responsibility Sensitive Safety frame­ work (RSS), and the Fuzzy Safety Model (FSM) proposed by the authors. As in the case of the two regulation models, also the RSS, although more sophisticated, assumes that the possible reaction by the driver is binary. This approach neglects the ability of a human driver to drive defensively and anticipate possible risks. Defensive drivers, indeed, may use comfortable decelerations in anticipation, to avoid finding themselves in an emergency situation. The FSM uses fuzzy logic to mimic this behavior.

%X The purpose of this paper is to analyse the role of the driver within automated driving systems using the Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork (EAST) method. We already know that as the level of automation increases within the driving task, the role of the driver shifts from that of an active operator (i.e. a driver driving) to more of a passive monitor (i.e. a driver monitoring). Task, social and information networks were constructed using the Hierarchical Task Analysis of Driving and evidence from driver verbalisations collected during a previous study to further explore the changing role of the driver using network analysis. A ‘broken links’ approach was conducted to show that momentary engagement in nondriving-related secondary tasks within an automated driving system can dramatically change the structure of driving system.

%T Waymo simulated driving behavior in reconstructed fatal crashes within an autonomous vehicle operating domain
%V 163
%P 106454
%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001457521004851
%X Preventing and mitigating high severity collisions is one of the main opportunities for Automated Driving Sys­ tems (ADS) to improve road safety. This study evaluated the Waymo Driver’s performance within real-world fatal collision scenarios that occurred in a specific operational design domain (ODD). To address the rare nature of high-severity collisions, this paper describes the addition of novel techniques to established safety impact assessment methodologies. A census of fatal, human-involved collisions was examined for years 2008 through 2017 for Chandler, AZ, which overlaps the current geographic ODD of the Waymo One fully automated ridehailing service. Crash reconstructions were performed on all available fatal collisions that involved a passen­ ger vehicle as one of the first collision partners and an available map in this ODD to determine the pre-impact kinematics of the vehicles involved in the original crashes. The final dataset consisted of a total of 72 crashes and 91 vehicle actors (52 initiators and 39 responders) for simulations. Next, a novel counterfactual “what-if’’ simulation method was developed to synthetically replace human-driven crash participants one at a time with the Waymo Driver. This study focused on the Waymo Driver’s performance when replacing one of the first two collision partners. The results of these simulations showed that the Waymo Driver was successful in avoiding all collisions when replacing the crash initiator, that is, the road user who made the initial, unexpected maneuver leading to a collision. Replacing the driver reacting (the responder) to the actions of the crash initiator with the Waymo Driver resulted in an estimated 82% of simulations where a collision was prevented and an additional 10% of simulations where the collision severity was mitigated (reduction in crash-level serious injury risk). The remaining 8% of simulations with the Waymo Driver in the responder role had a similar outcome to the original collision. All of these “unchanged” collisions involved both the original vehicle and the Waymo Driver being struck in the rear in a front-to-rear configuration. These results demonstrate the potential of fully automated driving systems to improve traffic safety compared to the performance of the humans originally involved in the collisions. The findings also highlight the major importance of driving behaviors that prevent entering a conflict situation (e.g. maintaining safe time gaps and not surprising other road users). However, methodological chal­ lenges in performing single instance counterfactual simulations based solely on police report data and uncer­ tainty in ADS performance may result in variable performance, requiring additional analysis and supplemental methodologies. This study’s methods provide insights on rare, severe events that would otherwise only be experienced after operating in extreme real-world driving distances (many billions of driving miles).

%X Higher level cognitive processes such as learning and mental models play a fundamental role in the success of automated driving, as technology can only be as good as our understanding and expectations of it. The present study investigated the development of these processes during interactions with driving automation. In a driving simulator study, N=52 participants completed several transitions between manual and Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) levels 2 and 3 automated driving. Self-reported learning progress and mental model development were assessed via questionnaires. In parallel, eye-tracking data were collected as a behavioral measure of higher level cognitive functions. The results demonstrated that self-reported learning and gaze behavior followed a power-law function; the power-law functions showed task specific parameter manifestations. The evolution of the mental models of the level 2 and level 3 human-machine interface continued up to the fifth contact, indicating a long lasting process. For researchers and practitioners, the present study implies that accurate mental models require up to 5 repeated interactions. Furthermore, learning progress with driving automation can be captured through gaze behavior.

%X The projected introduction of conditional automated driving systems to the market has sparked multifaceted research on human–machine interfaces (HMIs) for such systems. By moderating the roles of the human driver and the driving automation system, the HMI is indispensable in avoiding side eﬀects of automation such as mode confusion, misuse, and disuse. In addition to safety aspects, the usability of HMIs plays a vital role in improving the trust and acceptance of the automated driving system. This paper aggregates common research methods and ﬁndings based on an extensive literature review. Empirical studies, frameworks, and review articles are included. Findings and conclusions are presented with a focus on study characteristics such as test cases, dependent variables, testing environments, or participant samples. These methods and ﬁndings are discussed critically, taking into consideration requirements for usability assessments of HMIs in the context of conditional automated driving. The paper concludes with a derivation of recommended study characteristics framing best practice advice for the design of experiments. The advised selection of scenarios and metrics will be applied in a future validation study series comprising a driving simulator experiment and three real driving experiments on test tracks in Germany, the USA, and Japan.

%X The paper proposes a taxonomy for testing scenarios used in human factors research of Level 3 automated vehicles. Therefore, the literature was reviewed and testing scenarios were extracted. To categorize these scenarios, the four factors urgency, predictability, criticality and complexity of the driver response are introduced and deﬁned. Furthermore, testing scenarios are suggested in dependence of the most important human factors research questions in Level 3 automated driving. The taxonomy thereby serves as a guidance and framework for the scenario selection and design of experiments in the context of Level 3 automated vehicle guidance.

%T A scenario-based assessment approach for automated driving by using time series classification of human-driving behaviour
%P 1360-1365
%X Automated driving functions are under intensified development by industry and academia since the last decade. Due to the large operation space and various complex scenarios automated driving functions have to cope with, assessment efforts are expected to rise dramatically. In order to quantify benefits and risks of these functions in an efficient way, this paper describes a holistic approach for the assessment of automated driving by using real world driving data. Based on a scenario definition a suitable method for identifying relevant scenarios from real world driving data is described which is able to handle scenario specific characteristics such as the temporal and spatial dependencies of all traffic participants. For quantifying the effect of automated driving within the considered driving scenarios, the statistical indicator `effect size' is applied. The basic requirement that automated driving needs to operate within mixed traffic implies that the reference for assessment needs to be human manual driving behaviour.

%T In-vehicle displays to support driver anticipation of traffic conflicts in automated vehicles
%V 149
%P 105842
%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001457520316626
%X Objective: This paper investigates the effectiveness of in-vehicle displays in supporting drivers’ anticipation of traffic conflicts in automated vehicles (AVs).
Background: Providing takeover requests (TORs) along with information on automation capability (AC) has been found effective in supporting AV drivers’ reactions to traffic conflicts. However, it is unclear what type of in­ formation can support drivers in anticipating traffic conflicts, so they can intervene (pre-event action) or prepare to intervene (pre-event preparation) proactively to avert them.
Method: In a driving simulator study with 24 experienced and 24 novice drivers, we evaluated the effectiveness of two in-vehicle displays in supporting anticipatory driving in AVs with adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assistance: TORAC (TOR + AC information) and STTORAC displays (surrounding traffic (ST) information + TOR + AC information). Both displays were evaluated against a baseline display that only showed whether the automation was engaged.
Results: Compared to the baseline display, STTORAC led to more anticipatory driving behaviors (pre-event action or pre-event preparation) while TORAC led to less, along with decreased attention to environmental cues that indicated an upcoming event. STTORAC led to the highest level of driving safety, as indicated by minimum gap time for scenarios that required driver intervention, followed by TORAC, and then the baseline display.
Conclusions: Providing surrounding traffic information to drivers of AVs, in addition to TORs and automation capability information, can support their anticipation of potential traffic conflicts. Without the surrounding traffic information, drivers can over-rely on displays that provide TORs and automation capability information.

%T Takeover request (TOR) effects during different automated vehicle failures
%P 1-31
%U https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15472450.2021.1891536
%X Research on driving automation has investigated the use of takeover requests (TORs) to warn drivers about automation failures that require their intervention. Such failures can occur with information in the environment that drivers can use to anticipate them (e.g., system-limit failures) or without such information (e.g., system-malfunction failures). There is a lack of research comparing the effectiveness of TORs prior to these different failure types. We conducted a simulator study with 19 participants to investigate whether the effect of a TOR on drivers’ monitoring and takeover performance differed by failure type. Drivers were trained on automation limits so that they could identify upcoming system-limit failures. We evaluated gaze behaviors starting from 6 seconds before the failure (corresponding to TOR onset in TOR drives and the equivalent point in no-TOR drives) until drivers took over. The effect of TORs on monitoring the roadway was significant only for system-malfunction failures, with participants looking more at the roadway in TOR drives compared to no-TOR drives. For system-limit failures, the TOR did not provide any benefit in terms of visual attention to the roadway, likely because participants were already looking at the roadway because they could anticipate the failure. However, having a TOR for system-limit failures was associated with faster takeover time than not having a TOR. Although the TOR may not have had monitoring benefits when environmental information was available, our findings suggest it was still useful as a confirmation of impending failures and a prompt to take over control of the vehicle.

Since the concepts of safety and security can somewhat vary according to the context, the ﬁrst section of the paper deals with the scope and deﬁnitions that will be used in the sequel. The similarities and differences between the two domains are analyzed. A careful screening of the literature (this paper contains 201 references) made it possible to identify cross-fertilizations in various ﬁelds such as architectural concepts (e.g. defense in depth, security or safety kernels), graphical formalisms (e.g. attack trees), structured risk analyses or fault tolerance and prevention techniques.

%T On the Alignment of Safety and Security for Autonomous Vehicles
%X Safety is the primary requirement and the key challenge in autonomous vehicles. Any accidental failures (safety issue) and/or intentional attacks (security issue) may result in severe injury or loss of life. Thus, any missing consideration on either failures or attacks may lead to terrible consequence. Safety and security are interrelated and, therefore, have to be aligned early in the development process. International standards, International Organization for Standardization (ISO 26262), and Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE J3061), have been proposed for vehicle safety and security. However, they do not address all the aspects of autonomous vehicles as they rely on a human driver controlling the vehicle. In high automation vehicles (level 3 or above, as defined by the international standard SAE J3016), the autonomous driving system is fully responsible for driving the vehicle. Thus, different driving automation levels have to be taken into consideration when designing autonomous vehicle safety and security. We propose an approach for aligning safety and security lifecycles, based on SAE J3061, SAE J3016, and ISO 26262 standards at an early development phase. The proposed approach uses the Failure, Attack and Countermeasure (FACT) graph to connect safety failures, security attacks, and the associated countermeasures. The proposed approach is helpful for designing or tailoring the safety and security processes, and selecting appropriate countermeasures for autonomous vehicles taking into consideration the driving automation levels.

%T Towards the Application of Operational Design Domain based Scene Generation for Artificial Intelligence Training in Railway Automation
%X For automated, driverless rail transportation applications in open environments, Artificial Intelligence (AI)based methods are gaining importance, especially in computer vision and perception tasks. The safe operation of complex automated systems requires validation processes. For this purpose, the concept of Operational Design Domains (ODDs), driven by recent developments in the automotive industry, is gaining momentum, allowing to describe different aspects of operating conditions as scenes and scenarios. With regard to safety using AI-based systems, data coverage is needed, which can be enhanced by employing virtual reality in different forms. The creation of virtual scenes and sensor models allows the generation of synthetic sensor data and metadata to be used as a database for AI training processes. Furthermore, we want to use synthetic data generated in simulation to improve perception and data coverage.

%T Time Series Data Augmentation for Deep Learning: A Survey
%P 4653-4660
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12478
%X Deep learning performs remarkably well on many time series analysis tasks recently. The superior performance of deep neural networks relies heavily on a large number of training data to avoid overﬁtting. However, the labeled data of many realworld time series applications may be limited such as classiﬁcation in medical time series and anomaly detection in AIOps. As an effective way to enhance the size and quality of the training data, data augmentation is crucial to the successful application of deep learning models on time series data. In this paper, we systematically review different data augmentation methods for time series. We propose a taxonomy for the reviewed methods, and then provide a structured review for these methods by highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also empirically compare different data augmentation methods for different tasks including time series classiﬁcation, anomaly detection, and forecasting. Finally, we discuss and highlight ﬁve future directions to provide useful research guidance.

%X Time series classiﬁcation has been around for decades in the data-mining and machine learning communities. In this paper, we investigate the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for time series classiﬁcation. Such networks have been widely used in many domains like computer vision and speech recognition, but only a little for time series classiﬁcation. We design a convolutional neural network that consists of two convolutional layers. One drawback with CNN is that they need a lot of training data to be eﬃcient. We propose two ways to circumvent this problem: designing data-augmentation techniques and learning the network in a semi-supervised way using training time series from diﬀerent datasets. These techniques are experimentally evaluated on a benchmark of time series datasets.

%T SpecAugment: A Simple Data Augmentation Method for Automatic Speech Recognition
%P 2613-2617
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08779
%X We present SpecAugment, a simple data augmentation method for speech recognition. SpecAugment is applied directly to the feature inputs of a neural network (i.e., ﬁlter bank coefﬁcients). The augmentation policy consists of warping the features, masking blocks of frequency channels, and masking blocks of time steps. We apply SpecAugment on Listen, Attend and Spell networks for end-to-end speech recognition tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the LibriSpeech 960h and Swichboard 300h tasks, outperforming all prior work. On LibriSpeech, we achieve 6.8% WER on test-other without the use of a language model, and 5.8% WER with shallow fusion with a language model. This compares to the previous stateof-the-art hybrid system of 7.5% WER. For Switchboard, we achieve 7.2%/14.6% on the Switchboard/CallHome portion of the Hub5’00 test set without the use of a language model, and 6.8%/14.1% with shallow fusion, which compares to the previous state-of-the-art hybrid system at 8.3%/17.3% WER.

%T A Survey of Heterogeneous Transfer Learning
%I arXiv
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08459
%X The application of transfer learning, an approach utilizing knowledge from a source domain to enhance model performance in a target domain, has seen a tremendous rise in recent years, underpinning many real-world scenarios. The key to its success lies in the shared common knowledge between the domains, a prerequisite in most transfer learning methodologies. These methods typically presuppose identical feature spaces and label spaces in both domains, known as homogeneous transfer learning, which, however, is not always a practical assumption. Oftentimes, the source and target domains vary in feature spaces, data distributions, and label spaces, making it challenging or costly to secure source domain data with identical feature and label spaces as the target domain. Arbitrary elimination of these differences is not always feasible or optimal. Thus, heterogeneous transfer learning, acknowledging and dealing with such disparities, has emerged as a promising approach for a variety of tasks. Despite the existence of a survey in 2017 on this topic, the fast-paced advances post-2017 necessitate an updated, in-depth review. We therefore present a comprehensive survey of recent developments in heterogeneous transfer learning methods, offering a systematic guide for future research. Our paper reviews methodologies for diverse learning scenarios, discusses the limitations of current studies, and covers various application contexts, including Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Multimodality, and Biomedicine, to foster a deeper understanding and spur future research.

%X This paper presents a driver-speciﬁc risk recognition framework for autonomous vehicles that can extract inter-vehicle interactions. This extraction is carried out for urban driving scenarios in a driver-cognitive manner to improve the recognition accuracy of risky scenes. First, clustering analysis is applied to the operation data of drivers for learning the subjective assessment of risky scenes of different drivers and generating the corresponding risk label for each scene. Second, the graph representation model (GRM) is adopted to unify and construct the features of dynamic vehicles, inter-vehicle interactions, and static trafﬁc markings in real driving scenes into graphs. The driver-speciﬁc risk label provides ground truth to capture the risk evaluation criteria of different drivers. In addition, the graph model represents multiple features of the driving scenes. Therefore, the proposed framework can learn the risk-evaluating pattern of driving scenes of different drivers and establish driver-speciﬁc risk identiﬁers. Last, the performance of the proposed framework is evaluated via experiments conducted using real-world urban driving datasets collected by multiple drivers. The results show that the risks and their levels in real driving environments can be accurately recognized by the proposed framework.

%X Classiﬁcation of multivariate time series (MTS) has been tackled with a large variety of methodologies and applied to a wide range of scenarios. Reservoir computing (RC) provides efﬁcient tools to generate a vectorial, ﬁxed-size representation of the MTS that can be further processed by standard classiﬁers. Despite their unrivaled training speed, MTS classiﬁers based on a standard RC architecture fail to achieve the same accuracy of fully trainable neural networks. In this article, we introduce the reservoir model space, an unsupervised approach based on RC to learn vectorial representations of MTS. Each MTS is encoded within the parameters of a linear model trained to predict a low-dimensional embedding of the reservoir dynamics. Compared with other RC methods, our model space yields better representations and attains comparable computational performance due to an intermediate dimensionality reduction procedure. As a second contribution, we propose a modular RC framework for MTS classiﬁcation, with an associated open-source Python library. The framework provides different modules to seamlessly implement advanced RC architectures. The architectures are compared with other MTS classiﬁers, including deep learning models and time series kernels. Results obtained on the benchmark and real-world MTS data sets show that RC classiﬁers are dramatically faster and, when implemented using our proposed representation, also achieve superior classiﬁcation accuracy.

%X Forecasting models that are trained across sets of many time series, known as Global Forecasting Models (GFM), have shown recently promising results in forecasting competitions and real-world applications, outperforming many state-of-the-art univariate forecasting techniques. In most cases, GFMs are implemented using deep neural networks, and in particular Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which require a suﬃcient amount of time series to estimate their numerous model parameters. However, many time series databases have only a limited number of time series. In this study, we propose a novel, data augmentation based forecasting framework that is capable of improving the baseline accuracy of the GFM models in less data-abundant settings. We use three time series augmentation techniques: GRATIS, moving block bootstrap (MBB), and dynamic time warping barycentric averaging (DBA) to synthetically generate a collection of time series. The knowledge acquired from these augmented time series is then transferred to the original dataset using two different approaches: the pooled approach and the transfer learning approach. When building GFMs, in the pooled approach, we train a model on the augmented time series alongside the original time series dataset, whereas in the transfer learning approach, we adapt a pretrained model to the new dataset. In our evaluation on competition and real-world time series datasets, our proposed variants can signiﬁcantly improve the baseline accuracy of GFM models and outperform state-of-the-art univariate forecasting methods.

%X The modern automotive system, based on the convergence of information and communication technologies, is equipped with various functions to ensure vehicle safety and convenience of the driver. A driveridentiﬁcation technology is an effective method to perform vehicle-theft detection. It can also provide customized driver-personalization services, such as healthcare or insurance. In this article, we propose and evaluate a driveridentiﬁcation method based on wavelet transform by performing driving-pattern analysis for each driver. We compare the performances of three different machine-learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost for performing driver identiﬁcation. The proposed method is applicable to both binary and multiclass classiﬁcations for the driving data of ﬁve drivers. In the case of motorway, the XGBoost classiﬁer identiﬁes each driver and delivers an accuracy of up to 96.18% in binary classiﬁcation and an accuracy of 91.6% in multiclass classiﬁcation. Moreover, in the case of an urban road, the SVM classiﬁer achieves an accuracy of up to 95.07% in binary classiﬁcation and accuracy of 89.06% in multiclass classiﬁcation. The proposed method provides a context for a better understanding of the association between driver behavior, which is an in-vehicle event, and mechanical reactions. Our results shall help researchers to broaden the understanding of driver identiﬁcation using in-vehicle data.

%X Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm for solving sequential decision-making problems. Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in reinforcement learning upon the fast development of deep neural networks. Along with the promising prospects of reinforcement learning in numerous domains such as robotics and game-playing, transfer learning has arisen to tackle various challenges faced by reinforcement learning, by transferring knowledge from external expertise to facilitate the efﬁciency and effectiveness of the learning process. In this survey, we systematically investigate the recent progress of transfer learning approaches in the context of deep reinforcement learning. Speciﬁcally, we provide a framework for categorizing the state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches, under which we analyze their goals, methodologies, compatible reinforcement learning backbones, and practical applications. We also draw connections between transfer learning and other relevant topics from the reinforcement learning perspective and explore their potential challenges that await future research progress.

%X In order to assess AI/ML-based autonomous systems in terms of safety, it is not sufficient to assess the system w.r.t. potential failures that could lead to hazards (e.g., as proposed by standards such as IEC 61508, ARP 4761, etc.). Also, functional weaknesses/insufficiencies of the used algorithms according to Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF) standard ISO 21448 must be considered. In this paper, we present an approach for the safety assessment of systems incorporating AI/ML models using a Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and a Model-based Safety Assurance (MBSA) approach. Therefore, we introduce with Component Fault and Deficiency Trees (CFDTs) an extension of the model-based Component Fault Tree (CFT) methodology. Thereby, we are able to describe cause-effect relationships between individual failures and functional insufficiencies as well as system hazards and assess if all risks are mitigated. In this paper, we apply our approach to an industrial case study of a self-driving toy vehicle (the PANORover) and present our lessons learnt.

%X Vehicular networks play a key role in building intelligent transport systems for smart cities. For the purpose of achieving traffic efficiency, road safety, and traveler comfort, vehicles communicate and collaborate with each other as well as with the ﬁxed infrastructure. In practice, not all vehicles are trustworthy. A faulty or malicious vehicle may forward or share inaccurate or bogus information, which may cause adverse things, such as, road accidents and trafﬁc congestion. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate risk before a vehicle takes any decision. Various risk-based decision systems have already been proposed in the literature. The fuzzy risk-based decision model of vehicular networks is one of them. In this paper, we have proposed various extensions in the fuzzy risk-based decision model to achieve higher robustness, reliability, and completeness. We have presented the theoretical and simulation-based analysis and evaluation of the proposed scheme in a comprehensive manner. In addition, we have analytically cross veriﬁed the theoretical and simulation-based results. Qualitative comparison of the proposed scheme has also been presented in this work.

%X Existing risk assessment (RA) methodology used for autonomous vehicle (AV) development and validation is insufficient for future AV operations. Existing frameworks operate based on processes such as hazard analysis and risk assessment (HARA) where risk is defined based on functional hazardous event severity and the likelihood of occurrence. This is a static process performed during the development stage and relies on prior lessons learnt and know-how. A drawback of this is the omission of potential complex environments that could occur during real-time – especially with more stringent safety requirements for AV operating at higher automation levels. Therefore, there is a need for an additional framework to further enhance the safety levels of the AV, focusing on real-time instead of static risk assessment during development. In this paper, a novel real-time recursive RA framework (ReRAF) addresses the gap by creating a novel risk representation, predictive risk number (PRN), and eventual safety levels (SLs) in the temporal and spatial domain. This approach focuses on risk assessment based on AV collision to the detected hazardous object and controllability of the AV. A dynamic recursive RA continuously captures potentially hazardous events in real-time and compares them with past occurrences to predict future safety actions. ReRAF provides a continuous improvement on the RA and acts as an additional safety layer for AV operations.

%X Transfer learning has been a popular learning paradigm in the deep learning era, especially in annotationinsufficient scenarios. Better ImageNet pre-trained models have been demonstrated, from the perspective of architecture, by previous research to have better transferability to downstream tasks[26]. However, in this paper, we find that during the same pre-training process, models at middle epochs, which are inadequately pre-trained, can outperform fully trained models when used as feature extractors (FE), while the fine-tuning (FT) performance still grows with the source performance. This reveals that there is not a solid positive correlation between top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and the transferring result on target data. Based on the contradictory phenomenon between FE and FT that a better feature extractor fails to be fine-tuned better accordingly, we conduct comprehensive analyses on features before the softmax layer to provide insightful explanations. Our discoveries suggest that, during pre-training, models tend to first learn spectral components corresponding to large singular values and the residual components contribute more when fine-tuning.

%X Driver identiﬁcation has shown sustainable development in recent years in a wide variety of applications including but not limited to security, personalization, ﬂeet management, insurance telematics, or ride-hailing. However, the current progress suffers from several challenges such as costly data collections and the need for a huge amount of data from each individual for both driver identiﬁcation and impostor detection. Therefore, more novel and efﬁcient solutions are required to mitigate the existing challenges. In this paper, we address driver identiﬁcation and impostor detection tasks using driving behavior analysis of the drivers. We design a deep learning-based system architecture that analyzes windows of 30 seconds of driving data to capture the unique underlying characteristics of the individuals steering behavior based on which it further distinguishes the drivers. We also develop a novel strategy to tackle driver veriﬁcation and impostor detection tasks based on the combination of the proposed system architecture and Siamese networks concepts. We map the steering behavior of the drivers into latent representations which can be later used to train a similarity function. The performance of the proposed systems is tested over a real-world dataset of 95 drivers. The evaluation results indicate that our system outperforms well-established benchmarks and baseline methodologies.

%X Current trends in the automotive industry are reshaping the architectures and electromagnetic characteristics of road vehicles. Increasing electrification and connectivity are enabling considerable packaging flexibility and leading to radically different electromagnetic environments. At the same time, increasing automation of driving functions will require unprecedented levels of system dependability. However, existing EMC engineering processes were developed in a very different world of low system complexity and incremental technological development. In order to adapt to rising system complexity and the increasingly rapid pace of technological change, it is considered that a more agile risk-based approach is better suited to ensure the electromagnetic resilience of future vehicles and other complex systems. This paper outlines a Bayesian network approach that allows the combination of both technical and nontechnical aspects in assessing the likelihood of issues that could lead to system-level risks. This approach could be used to help achieve EM resilience from the earliest stages of product development, where the detailed information required to undertake detailed risk assessment is generally unavailable.

%T Risk Management Core -- Towards an Explicit Representation of Risk in Automated Driving
%V 12
%P 33200-33217
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07715
%X While current automotive safety standards provide implicit guidance on how unreasonable risk can be avoided, manufacturers are required to specify risk acceptance criteria for automated driving systems (SAE Level 3+). However, the ‘unreasonable’ level of risk of automated driving systems (SAE Level 3+) is not yet concisely deﬁned. Solely applying current safety standards to such novel systems could potentially not be sufﬁcient for their acceptance. As risk is managed with implicit knowledge about safety measures in existing automotive standards, an explicit alignment with risk acceptance criteria is challenging. Hence, we propose an approach for an explicit representation and management of risk, which we call the Risk Management Core. The proposal of this process framework is based on requirements elicited from current safety standards and apply the Risk Management Core to the task of specifying safe behavior for an automated driving system in an example scenario.

%X To assure that an autonomous car is driving safely on public roads, its object detection module should not only work correctly, but show its prediction conﬁdence as well. Previous object detectors driven by deep learning do not explicitly model uncertainties in the neural network. We tackle with this problem by presenting practical methods to capture uncertainties in a 3D vehicle detector for Lidar point clouds. The proposed probabilistic detector represents reliable epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty in classiﬁcation and localization tasks. Experimental results show that the epistemic uncertainty is related to the detection accuracy, whereas the aleatoric uncertainty is inﬂuenced by vehicle distance and occlusion. The results also show that we can improve the detection performance by 1% − 5% by modeling the aleatoric uncertainty.

%X Autonomous driving technology is rapidly advancing towards level 5 autonomy along with claims of increasing safety on roads. However, a proper validation of such safetycritical, complex systems and of their reliability still needs to be addressed adequately. To this end, standard exhaustive methods are inappropriate to validate the probabilistic algorithms widely used in this ﬁeld and new solutions need to be adopted. In this work, we present a new approach where formal veriﬁcation is employed to validate systems with probabilistic predictions. In particular, we focus on the risk assessment generated by a probabilistic perception system, the Conditional Monte Carlo Dense Occupancy Tracker (CMCDOT). This framework provides an environment representation through Bayesian probabilistic occupancy grids and estimates Time-to-Collision probabilities for every static and dynamic part of the grid in near future. Focusing on the validation of the probabilistic collision risk estimation, we adopt the CARLA simulator to generate a large number of realistic intersection crossing scenarios with two vehicles. The formal veriﬁcation is then performed using the XTL model checker of the CADP toolbox, based on the deﬁnition of appropriate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Finally, a quantitative analysis that goes beyond classical temporal logic veriﬁcation is provided.

%X As autonomous vehicles (AVs) take on growing Operational Design Domains (ODDs), they need to go through a systematic, transparent, and scalable evaluation process to demonstrate their beneﬁts to society. Current scenario sampling techniques for AV performance evaluation usually focus on a speciﬁc functionality, such as lane changing, and do not accommodate a transfer of information about an AV system from one ODD to the next. In this paper, we reformulate the scenario sampling problem across ODDs and functionalities as a submodular optimization problem. To do so, we abstract AV performance as a Bayesian Hierarchical Model, which we use to infer information gained by revealing performance in new scenarios. We propose the information gain as a measure of scenario relevance and evaluation progress. Furthermore, we leverage the submodularity, or diminishing returns, property of the information gain not only to ﬁnd a near-optimal scenario set, but also to propose a stopping criterion for an AV performance evaluation campaign. We ﬁnd that we only need to explore about 7.5% of the scenario space to meet this criterion, a 23% improvement over Latin Hypercube Sampling.

%X The advent of new vehicular advances and accessibility of new network access mediums have evolved service providers with heterogeneous-vehicular collaboration. The performance of heterogeneousvehicular collaboration depends on the possibility of accurate, up-to-date vehicular information shared by cooperative-awareness messages (CAMs) among neighboring vehicles, but exchanging wrong mobility coordinates leads to disruption on the internet of vehicles (IoVs). To address these issues, a misbehavior detection approach is proposed that acts as a second wall of defense. The scheme is divided into three phases: context procurement, context sharing, and misbehavior detection. Mathematical modeling has been done to evaluate Sybil attack and false message generation attack detection under misbehavior detection. The proposed scheme attains 99% in detecting false message generation attacks and 98.5% in detecting Sybil attacks. Additionally, false-positive rate, overhead detection, and false-measures are evaluated, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.

%X The term metaverse, which shows a 3D-designed virtual medium where people can connect through their avatars to spend time, telecommute, and socialize, has entered our lives fast. There are limitless implementations that can take place in the metaverse. Integration of another technological innovation, which is autonomous vehicles to the metaverse, is at hand. There are numerous alternative uses of autonomous vehicles in the metaverse. In this study, three alternative implementation options for autonomous vehicles in the metaverse are investigated. These alternatives are evaluated using the proposed multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method under twelve different criteria, which are grouped under four main aspects, namely technological, societal, legal and ethical, and transportation. A novel hybrid model based on q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) which consists of three stages is presented to express the framework deﬁnition, calculate the weight coefﬁcients of the criteria, and rank various alternatives. In the ﬁrst stage, the structure of the problem is created. In the second stage, q-ROFSs based OPA algorithm is used to calculate the weights of the criteria. In the last stage, q-ROFSs based RAFSI (Ranking of Alternatives through Functional mapping of criterion sub-intervals into a Single Interval) is applied to choose the best alternative among the three alternatives. Finally, we present a case study to verify our proposed method. The results of this study have the potential to be used as a guide by decision-makers of the metaverse while integrating autonomous vehicles into the transportation system.

%X We present an integrated method for safety assessment of automated driving systems which covers the aspects of functional safety and safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF), including identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of hazardous scenarios. The proposed method uses and combines established exploration and analytical tools for hazard analysis and risk assessment in the automotive domain, while adding important enhancements to enable their applicability to the uncharted territory of safety analyses for automated driving. The method is tailored to support existing safety processes mandated by the standards ISO 26262 and ISO/PAS 21448 and complements them where necessary. It has been developed in close cooperation with major German automotive manufacturers and suppliers within the PEGASUS project (https:// www.pegasusprojekt.de/en). Practical evaluation has been carried out by applying the method to the PEGASUS Highway-Chauﬀeur, a conceptual automated driving function considered as a common reference system within the project.

%X Reliability engineering has well-established analysis techniques to design critical systems that will be safe to operate. Two already field-proven techniques are the FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) and the FMECA (Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis). These techniques, recommended or required by several supervisory authorities or independent assessments, will continue to be the main assets for the analysis of potential failures and faults. This mapping study revisits FMECA and FTA from the perspective of how they are used when dealing with systems with Artificial Intelligence (AI) components. After the literature database search and selection, 24 primary sources were leveraged to map them regarding their context, scope, considerations, and maturity. The diversity of safety-critical application domains and functions, and the need of more evidences from the evaluations of the proposed approaches, suggest that this field requires a pressing attention. The extracted considerations can be relevant elements of industrial guidelines.

%X Even though motion planning for automated vehicles has been extensively discussed for more than two decades, it is still a highly active ﬁeld of research with a variety of different approaches having been published in the recent years. When considering the market introduction of SAE Level 3+ vehicles, the topic of motion planning will most likely be subject to even more detailed discussions between safety and user acceptance. This paper shall discuss parameters of the motion planning problem and requirements to an environment model. The focus is put on the representation of different types of uncertainty at the example of sensor occlusion, arguing the importance of a well-deﬁned interface between decision making and trajectory generation.

%X This paper proposes a risk assessment method based on trajectory data which are used to quantify the risk faced by drivers for application in autonomous vehicles. A risk ﬁeld is derived from the ﬁeld theory of trafﬁc ﬂow, based on which the risk repulsion indicator of car-following is determined. By describing the repulsion force perceived by drivers in the process of car-following, the risk faced by drivers is assessed. The validity of the indicator is established from crash trajectory data obtained by simulation, and a binary logit model is employed to predict the crash. The result shows that the risk repulsion indicator based on risk ﬁeld theory can distinguish crash states and non-crash states signiﬁcantly. The prediction accuracy of binary logit model based on risk repulsion performs better than that of crash prediction model based on loop detector data.

%X Autonomous driving systems (ADS) in recent years have been the subject of focus, evolving as one of the major mobility disruptors and being a potential candidate for deployment in urban cities due to urbanization. ADS is the system within the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) that enables automation. The different ADS technologies that enable autonomous vehicles have reached a certain maturity that no longer focus on technological deployment, but rather on the safe deployment on public roads. However, existing standards that validate functional safety and Risk Assessment (RA) may not be sufﬁcient to tackle the increased complexity of ADS compared to traditional vehicles. This demand in ADS safety is exponentially increasing in tandem with the increase of AV automation levels. ADS are exposed to diverse environmental conditions and therefore subjected to operational risks while attempting to mimic the human driver responses. Moreover, the recent use of artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning in the industry further shapes the way how ADS development will become in the future. This paper explains the importance of RA coverage for AV and provides a comparison and summary of existing RA methodologies. Thereafter, a recommendation of RAs for AV as potential solutions in meeting ISO 26262 and ISO/PAS 21448 standards.

%T Human Factors Issues Associated with Limited Ability Autonomous Driving Systems: Drivers’ Allocation of Visual Attention to the Forward Roadway
%C Bolton Landing, New York, USA>

%U http://pubs.lib.uiowa.edu/drive/article/id/27368/
%X This study characterized driver behavior and established a foundation for defining functional performance requirements associated with a Limited Ability Autonomous Driving System (LAADS) – a system capable of automated steering and speed/headway maintenance tasks on freeways, but does not relieve drivers of all driving tasks. The research was designed to examine and reveal potential issues associated with the use of semi-autonomous systems, exploring impacts on willingness to engage in secondary non-driving related tasks, and driver allocation of visual attention while operating under LAADS (ACC and Lane Centering). Results found meaningful differences in the allocation of visual attention across ACC and LAADS driving under situations where drivers were engaged in a secondary task. Overall findings suggest that given a rudimentary, but reliable, LAADS system (one which does not monitor or otherwise restrict behavior) drivers are likely to increase the frequency of secondary task interactions, and engage in risky tasks that are likely to increase extended glances away from the forward roadway.

%X The scenario-based tests have been an important means of improving the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Moreover, ensuring the ﬁdelity of generated scenarios is a safeguard for scenario-based tests. This article presents a new approach to generate twin scenarios for the virtual testing of AVs using meta scenarios. By extracting key parameter clusters from real-world scenarios and redeﬁning and reassembling them, a large number of twin scenarios are generated. This approach addresses the need for diverse scenarios in AV virtual testing and enhances efﬁciency and hazard detection in the Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) assessment. The validity of twin scenarios, their temporal logic, and social attributes are veriﬁed using the UPPAAL tool, ensuring reliability and ﬁdelity in virtual testing with AV digital twins. This innovative method offers a valuable solution to address challenges in AV virtual testing and improve the overall assessment process.

%T Human–Machine Shared Lateral Control Strategy for Intelligent Vehicles Based on Human Driver Risk Perception Reliability
%V 7

%X Intelligent vehicle (IV) technology has developed rapidly in recent years. However, achieving fully unmanned driving still presents numerous challenges, which means that human drivers will continue to play a vital role in vehicle operation for the foreseeable future. Human–machine shared driving, involving cooperation between a human driver and an automated driving system (AVS), has been widely regarded as a necessary stage for the development of IVs. Focusing on IV driving safety, this study proposed a human–machine shared lateral control strategy (HSLCS) based on the reliability of driver risk perception. The HSLCS starts by identifying the effective areas of driver risk perception based on eye movements. It establishes an anisotropic driving risk field, which serves as the foundation for the AVS to assess risk levels. Building upon the cumulative and diminishing effects of risk perception, the proposed approach leverages the driver's risk perception effective area and converts the risk field into a representation aligned with the driver's perspective. Subsequently, it quantifies the reliability of the driver's risk perception by using area-matching rules. Finally, based on the driver’s risk perception reliability and differences in lateral driving operation between the human driver and the AVS, the dynamic distribution of driving authority is achieved through a fuzzy rule-based system, and the human–machine shared lateral control is completed by using model predictive control. The HSLCS was tested across various scenarios on a driver-in-the-loop test platform. The results show that the HSLCS can realize the synergy and complementarity of human and machine intelligence, effectively ensuring the safety of IV operation.

%T The Surface Accelerations Reference—A Large-Scale, Interactive Catalog of Passenger Vehicle Accelerations
%V 24

%U https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10108532/
%X There is a need for a large-scale, real world, diverse, and context rich vehicle acceleration catalog that can be used to design, analyze, and compare various intelligent transportation systems. This paper fulfills three primary objectives. First, it provides such a catalog through the Surface Accelerations Reference, which is openly available as an interactive analytics tool as well as an open and downloadable dataset. The Surface Accelerations Reference statistically describes the driving profiles of about 3,500 individuals contributing 34 million miles of continuous driving data collected in the Second Strategic Highway Research Program Naturalistic Driving Study (SHRP 2 NDS). These profiles were created by summarizing billions of longitudinal and lateral acceleration epochs experienced by the participants. Second, this paper introduces a standardized methodology for creating such a catalog so that similar acceleration profiles can be produced for other human cohorts or automated driving systems. Finally, the data are used to analyze the effect of roadway speed category on the rates of lateral and longitudinal acceleration epochs at various thresholds. It is observed that, for the median driver, the rates of epochs are up to three orders of magnitude higher on low-speed roads as compared to high-speed roads. This catalog will facilitate intelligent vehicle system designers to compare and tune their systems for safer driving experiences. It will also allow agencies with similar data to create comparable catalogs facilitating safety and behavioral comparisons between populations.

%X When Autonomous vehicles have come into the limelight both in the field of practical use and in the research domain, the continuous complexity of shared decision-making, liability, and ethics in a human-autonomy team is still finding ways to be resolved. Especially in level 4 autonomous vehicles, when almost everything is to be done by the autonomous system, the role of humans needs to be more structured. In this paper, we discuss the safety concern of a level 4 autonomous vehicle, keeping the human users in focus. We identify the critical safety concerns that can occur in a level 4 autonomous vehicle due to the autonomous system's error and how humans in and out of the loop can play a role there. We have three major topics discussed in this paper regarding the safety of level 4 autonomous vehicles: 1) identification of major safety issues of a level 4 autonomous vehicle, where we discuss the safety issue that can arise and whether the human user's invention can prevent the hazard, 2) discussion of the factors which needs to be considered to build an efficient Human-Machine Interface, through which the human user will be in the loop of the operation of the autonomous system and can play a crucial role to prevent potential safety hazard caused by the autonomous system error, 3) potential use of brain-machine interface technology to provide more robustness to the human-autonomy teaming in an autonomous vehicle context.

%T Evaluation of the effects of age-friendly human-machine interfaces on the driver’s takeover performance in highly automated vehicles
%V 67
%P 78-100
%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369847819304176
%X The ability to continue driving into old age is strongly associated with older adults’ mobility and wellbeing for those that have been dependant on car use for most of their adult lives. The emergence of highly automated vehicles (HAVs) may have the potential to allow older adults to drive longer and safer. In HAVs, when operating in automated mode, drivers can be completely disengaged from driving, but occasionally they may be required to take back the control of the vehicle. The human-machine interfaces in HAVs play an important role in the safe and comfortable usage of HAVs. To date, only limited research has explored how to design age-friendly HMIs in HAVs and evaluate their effectiveness. This study designed three HMI concepts based on older drivers’ requirements, and conducted a driving simulator investigation with 76 drivers (39 older drivers and 37 younger drivers) to evaluate the effect and relative merits of these HMIs on drivers’ takeover performance, workload and attitudes. Results showed that the ‘R + V’ HMI (informing drivers of vehicle status together with providing the reasons for the manual driving takeover request) led to better takeover performance, lower perceived workload and highly positive attitudes, and is the most beneﬁcial and effective HMI. In addition, The ‘V’ HMI (verbally informing the drivers about vehicle status, including automation mode and speed, before the manual driving takeover request) also had a positive effect on drivers’ takeover performance, perceived workload and attitudes. However, the ‘R’ HMI (solely informing drivers about the reasons for takeover as part of the takeover request) affected older and younger drivers differently, and resulted in deteriorations in performance and more risky takeover for both older and younger drivers compared to the baseline HMI. Moreover, signiﬁcant age difference was observed in the takeover performance and perceived workload. Above all, this research highlights the signiﬁcance of taking account older drivers’ requirements into the design of HAVs and the importance of collaboration between automated vehicle and cooperative ITS research communities.

%X Delay on the motorways can be reduced by trafﬁc management measures changing driving behaviour, which need to be tested before implementation. Microscopic trafﬁc simulation is well suited for this, if sufﬁciently accurate. Recent studies show that drivers do not continuously change their acceleration, but rather at speciﬁc moments in time. These moments are called longitudinal action points. Also for lane changing, moments in time can be identiﬁed when drivers start and end changing lanes, so called lateral action points. This paper develops a methodology to ﬁnd these action points. Data of individual driving behavior, collected from a helicopter, show that the approach with action points is plausible. Moreover, the longitudinal and lateral action points are correlated. Current models not incorporating this discontinuous behaviour correctly, might produce incorrect predictions.

%X Current approaches to identifying driving heterogeneity face challenges in capturing the diversity of driving characteristics and understanding the fundamental patterns from a driving behaviour mechanism standpoint. This study introduces a comprehensive framework for identifying driving heterogeneity from an Action-chain perspective. First, a rule-based segmentation technique that considers the physical meanings of driving behaviour is proposed. Next, an Action phase Library including descriptions of various driving behaviour patterns is created based on the segmentation ﬁndings. The Action-chain concept is then introduced by implementing Action phase transition probability, followed by a method for evaluating driving heterogeneity. Employing real-world datasets for evaluation, our approach effectively identiﬁes driving heterogeneity for both individual drivers and trafﬁc ﬂow while providing clear interpretations. These insights can aid the development of accurate driving behaviour theory and trafﬁc ﬂow models, ultimately beneﬁting trafﬁc performance, and potentially leading to aspects such as improved road capacity and safety.

%X Distracted or drowsy driving is unsafe driving behavior responsible for thousands of crashes every year. Studying driver behavior has challenges associated with observing drivers in their natural environment. The naturalistic driving study (NDS) has become the most sought-after approach, since it eliminates the bias of a controlled setup, allowing researchers to understand drivers’ behavior in real-world scenarios. Video recordings collected in NDS research are incredibly insightful in identifying driver errors. Computer vision techniques have been used to autonomously analyze video data and classify drivers’ behavior. While computer vision scientists focus on image analytics, NDS researchers are interested in the factors impacting driver behavior. This survey paper makes a concerted effort to serve both communities by comprehensively reviewing studies, describing their data collection, computer vision techniques implemented, and performance in classifying driver behavior. The scope is limited to studies employing at least one camera observing the driver inside a vehicle. Based on their objective, papers have been classiﬁed as detecting low-level (e.g. head orientation) or high-level (e.g. distraction detection) driver information. Papers have been further classiﬁed based on the datasets they employ. In addition to twelve public datasets, many private datasets have also been identiﬁed, and their data collection design is discussed to highlight any impact on model performance. Across each task, algorithms employed and their performance are discussed to establish a baseline. A comparison of different frameworks for NDS video data analytics throws light on the existing gaps in the state-of-the-art that can be addressed by future computer vision research.

%X Despite recent advancement in autonomous vehicles, limitations of autonomous driving system still remain. When the autonomous driving system encounters failure, it hands over dynamic driving task to the driver. In the event of a failure of the autonomous driving system, effective take-over request should be issued according to driver’s status to guarantee safety and comfort of a driver. To devise the optimal alert modalities for take-over request that can minimize the risk of failure in the autonomous driving system, the following factors were drawn out for the experimental design: 4 scenarios for take-over request through the case analysis of cause of autonomous driving disengagement; and veriﬁable vehicle alert modalities of visual, auditory, and tactile aspects for take-over request through the literature search and market research. Then, we have established a virtual reality simulator for experiment environment that can effectively identify driver’s status based on human factors. This study will ﬁnd out effective multi-modality for take-over request through an analysis of statistically signiﬁcant differences according to driver’s status based on human factors by drawing the quantitative/qualitative data based on scenarios for take-over request and combinations of vehicle alert modalities of visual, auditory, and tactile aspects obtained from the results of previous studies analyzed in this experiment environment.

%X Self-driving vehicles are able to drive on their own as long as the requirements of their autonomous systems are met. If the system reaches the boundary of its capabilities, the system has to de-escalate (e.g. emergency braking) or hand over control to the human driver. Accordingly, the design of a functional handover assistant requires that it enable drivers to both take over control and feel comfortable while doing so – even when they were “out of the loop” with other tasks. We introduce a process to hand over control from a full self-driving system to manual driving, and propose a number of handover implementation strategies. Moreover, we designed and implemented a handover assistant based on users’ preferences and conducted a user study with 30 participants, whose distraction was ensured by a realistic distractor task. Our evaluation shows that car-driver handovers prompted by multimodal (auditory and visual) warnings are a promising strategy to compensate for system boundaries of autonomous vehicles. The insights we gained from the take-over behavior of drivers led us to formulate recommendations for more realistic evaluation settings and the design of future handover assistants.

%T Usability testing of three visual HMIs for assisted driving: How design impacts driver distraction and mental models

%X There is a variety of visual human-machine interfaces (HMI) designed across vehicle manufacturers that support drivers while supervising driving automation features, such as adaptive cruise control (ACC). These various designs communicate the same limited amount of information to drivers about their ACC system and it is unclear which HMI designs impact driver distraction the least or how their design could be modified to help drivers develop more accurate mental models of their ACC system. Using a user-centred design (UCD) approach, we designed a speedometer to inform drivers about some of the system’s capabilities and then invited 23 drivers to use ACC in a low-fidelity driving simulator to compare the usability of three HMIs using eye-tracking, response times, and qualitative data. Our attempt at designing an intuitive and more informative speedometer received mixed results, but design recommendations are given regarding the indication of the set target speed, set time gap between vehicles (headway distance), and system mode (conventional or adaptive cruise).

%X The cybersecurity of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is an important emerging area of research in trafﬁc safety. Because human failure is the most common reason for a successful cyberattack, human-factor researchers and psychologists might improve AV cybersecurity by researching how to decrease the probability of a successful attack. We review some areas of research connected to the human factor in cybersecurity and ﬁnd many potential issues. Psychologists might research the characteristics of people prone to cybersecurity failure, the types of scenarios they fail in and the factors that inﬂuence this failure or over-trust of AV. Human behavior during a cyberattack might be researched, as well as how to educate people about cybersecurity. Multitasking has an effect on the ability to defend against a cyberattack and research is needed to set the appropriate policy. Human-resource researchers might investigate the skills required for personnel working in AV cybersecurity and how to detect potential defectors early. The psychological proﬁle of cyber attackers should be investigated to be able to set policies to decrease their motivation. Finally, the decrease of driver’s driving skills as a result of using AV and its connection to cybersecurity skills is also worth of research.

%T Towards Human-Vehicle Interaction: Driving Risk Analysis Under Different Driver Vigilance States and Driving Risk Detection Method
%U https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s42154-022-00209-w
%X The driver's behavior plays a crucial role in transportation safety. It is widely acknowledged that driver vigilance is a major contributor to traffic accidents. However, the quantitative impact of driver vigilance on driving risk has yet to be fully explored. This study aims to investigate the relationship between driver vigilance and driving risk, using data recorded from 28 drivers who maintain a speed of 80 km/h on a monotonous highway for 2 hours. The k-means and linear fitting methods are used to analyze the driving risk distribution under different driver vigilance states. Additionally, this study proposes a research framework for analyzing driving risk and develops three classification models (KNN, SVM, and DNN) to recognize the driving risk status. The results show that the frequency of low-risk incidents is negatively correlated with the driver's vigilance level, whereas the frequency of moderate-risk and high-risk incidents is positively correlated with the driver's vigilance level. The DNN model performs the best, achieving an accuracy of 0.972, recall of 0.972, precision of 0.973, and f1-score of 0.972, compared to KNN and SVM. This research could serve as a valuable reference for the design of warning systems and intelligent vehicles.

%T Improving young drivers’ speed compliance through a single dose of feedback
%V 95
%P 228-238
%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369847823000839
%X Feedback is an important component in learning, including the development of safe driving for novice drivers. Research shows that feedback can reduce the number of speeding occurrences, and the likelihood of speeding-related incidents and accidents, but it is not clear how often feedback should be provided. The present study builds on a series of laboratory and field studies that showed providing feedback to novice drivers about their speeding performance, financial and safety implications on one occasion after a baseline drive, improved their speed compliance on a subsequent test drive. The benefit was evident six months post intervention. The aim of the current study was to investigate on-road whether this effect could be enhanced by more frequent feedback of the same type. Seventy young drivers (54% male) were randomly allocated to one of five groups in which frequency of feedback was varied: Feedback provided on one, two, three or four occasions each spaced one week apart or no feedback. The effect of frequency of feedback was tested at weekly intervals for 4 weeks (i.e., immediately, then at subsequent sessions that occurred one, two, and three weeks after the first), then six months post-intervention. The results revealed that feedback provided on only one or two occasions was the most effective in reducing young drivers’ average speed and percentage of time speeding for lower (50 km/h) and higher (80 km/h) speed zones. The benefits were not enhanced by multiple feedback occasions. The Control (no feedback) group showed the worst speed compliance, with mean speed and percentage of time speeding increasing from the baseline. These results have important implications for the development of new training approaches to improve young drivers’ speeding behaviour.

%X Driver drowsiness and distraction are two main reasons for trafﬁc accidents and the related ﬁnancial losses. Therefore, researchers have been working for more than a decade on designing driver inattention monitoring systems. As a result, several detection techniques for the detection of both drowsiness and distraction have been proposed in the literature. Some of these techniques were successfully adopted and implemented by the leading car companies. This paper discusses and provides a comprehensive insight into the well-established techniques for driver inattention monitoring and introduces the use of most recent and futuristic solutions exploiting mobile technologies such as smartphones and wearable devices. Then, a proposal is made for the active of such systems into car-to-car communication to support vehicular ad hoc network’s (VANET’s) primary aim of safe driving. We call this approach the dissemination of driver behavior via C2C communication. Throughout this paper, the most remarkable studies of the last ﬁve years were examined thoroughly in order to reveal the recent driver monitoring techniques and demonstrate the basic pros and cons. In addition, the studies were categorized into two groups: driver drowsiness and distraction. Then, research on the driver drowsiness was further divided into two main subgroups based on the exploitation of either visual features or nonvisual features. A comprehensive compilation, including used features, classiﬁcation methods, accuracy rates, system parameters, and environmental details, was represented as tables to highlight the (dis)advantages and/or limitations of the aforementioned categories. A similar approach was also taken for the methods used for the detection of driver distraction.

%X Autonomous vehicle research has been prevalent for well over a decade but only recently has there been a small amount of research conducted on the human interaction that occurs in autonomous vehicles. Although functional software and sensor technology is essential for safe operation, which has been the main focus of autonomous vehicle research, handling all elements of human interaction is also a very salient aspect of their success. This paper will provide an overview of the importance of human vehicle interaction in autonomous vehicles, while considering relevant related factors that are likely to impact adoption. Particular attention will be given to prior research conducted on germane areas relating to control in the automobile, in addition to the different elements that are expected to affect the likelihood of success for these vehicles initially developed for human operation. This paper will also include a discussion of the limited research conducted to consider interactions with humans and the current state of published functioning software and sensor technology that exists.

%T Mining the Critical Factors of Hazardous Material Road Transportation Accidents From Chinese Investigation Reports
%V 24
%N 10
%P 11121-11131
%U https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10149147/
%X Rather than reducing losses after an accident, identifying critical accident factors is a better approach because it can be used to prevent accidents. Hazard materials (HAZMAT) road transportation is a complex sociotechnical system that involves three major procedures. Staff, vehicles, and tanks directly participate in this transport system, while different companies and government departments manage or supervise personnel and equipment. Moreover, all these stakeholders must obey ten types of industrial standards or regulations. The accident investigation reports contain the critical factors of the accident. Specifically, using a series of natural language processing (NLP) technologies, the accident causes in 137 Chinese reports are extracted, classified, and formatted. Then, a Bayesian network (BN) is constructed using the structural restrictions learning algorithm based on structured accident data from the reports. Finally, critical accident factors are revealed through sensitivity analysis of the BN. The results show that inadequate or delayed operation, which includes subordinate management factors and supervision factors, is the most critical factor among the five factors grouped. Actual accident data can explain the results. Combining the actual data and accident model, the accident analysis approach proposed in this paper considers the structural relations and frequency of accident factors.

%U http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1518/001872097778543886
%X This paper addresses theoretical, empirical, and analytical studies pertaining to human use, misuse, disuse, and abuse of automation technology. Use refers to the voluntary activation or disengagement of automation by human operators. Trust, mental workload, and risk can influence automation use, but interactions between factors and large individual differences make prediction of automation use difficult. Misuse refers to over reliance on automation, which can result in failures of monitoring or decision biases. Factors affecting the monitoring of automation include workload, automation reliability and consistency, and the saliency of automation state indicators. Disuse, or the neglect or underutilization of automation, is commonly caused by alarms that activate falsely. This often occurs because the base rate of the condition to be detected is not considered in setting the trade-off between false alarms and omissions. Automation abuse, or the automation of functions by designers and implementation by managers without due regard for the consequences for human performance, tends to define the operator's roles as by-products of the automation. Automation abuse can also promote misuse and disuse of automation by human operators. Understanding the factors associated with each of these aspects of human use of automation can lead to improved system design, effective training methods, and judicious policies and procedures involving automation use.

%X Road related fatalities are a global problem. Speed management remains an elusive skill for many young drivers. The main aim of the study is to understand self-reported speeding behavior, as well as the situations in which young novice and young experienced drivers exceed the speed limit. Three hundred and thirty-four young drivers completed the online driving survey. All participants were grouped based on experience (i.e., novice vs. experienced) and type of drivers (i.e., conformer, dettered, manipulator and defier). Overall, the results showed similarities between responses about their speeding behavior for both young novice and young experienced drivers. The results illustrate that the most common situations in which young drivers exceed the posted speed limit are road design, poor signage, rush, human error, and low traffic volume areas. These results are valuable in developing training to ‘calibrate’ young drivers’ actual and perceived behavior and improve their speed compliance.

%T Addressing the Practical Limitations of Noisy-OR Using Conditional Inter-Causal Anti-Correlation with Ranked Nodes
%V 31
%N 4
%P 813-817
%U https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8481414/
%X Numerous methods have been proposed to simplify the problem of eliciting complex conditional probability tables in Bayesian networks. One of the most popular methods -“Noisy-OR”- approximates the required relationship in many real-world situations between a set of variables that are potential causes of an effect variable. However, the Noisy-OR function has the conditional inter-causal independence (CII) property which means that ‘explaining away’ behavior—one of the most powerful beneﬁts of BN inference—is not present when the effect variable is observed as false. Hence, for many real-world problems where the Noisy-OR has been used or proposed, it may be deﬁcient as an approximation of the required relationship. However, there is a very simple alternative solution, namely to deﬁne the variables as ranked nodes and to use the ranked node weighted average function. This does not have the CII property—instead, we prove it has the conditional anti-correlation property required to ensure that explaining away works in all cases. Moreover, ranked node variables are not restricted to binary states, and hence provide a more comprehensive and general solution to Noisy-OR in all cases.

When considering the market introduction of SAE Level 3+ vehicles, the topic of motion planning will most likely be subject to even more detailed discussions between safety and user acceptance. This paper shall discuss parameters of the motion planning problem and requirements to an environment model.

%T Bayesian regression based condition monitoring approach for effective reliability prediction of random processes in autonomous energy supply operation
%V 201
%P 106966
%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0951832019312001
%X The probabilistic analysis on condition monitoring data has been widely established through the energy supply process to specify the optimum risk remediation program. In such studies, the fluctuations and uncertainties of the operational data including the variability between source of data and the correlation of observations, have to be incorporated if the efficiency is of importance. This study presents a novel probabilistic methodology based on observation data for signifying the impact of risk factors on safety indicators when consideration is given to uncertainty quantification. It provides designers, risk managers and operators a framework for risk mitigation planning within the energy supply processes, whilst also assessing the online reliability. These calculations address the involved and, most of the time, unconsidered risk to make a prediction of safety conditions of the operation in future. To this end, the generalized linear model (GLM) is applied to offer the explanatory model as a regression function for risk factors and safety indicators. Hierarchical Bayesian approach (HBA) is then inferred for the calculations of regression function including interpretation of the intercept and coefficient factors. With Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation from likelihood function and prior distribution, the HBA is capable of capturing the aforementioned fluctuations and uncertainties in the process of obtaining the posterior values of the intercept and coefficient factors. To illustrate the capabilities of the developed framework, an autonomous operation of Natural Gas Regulating and Metering Station in Italy has been considered as case study.

%T Scenario-based Extended HARA Incorporating Functional Safety & SOTIF for Au- tonomous Driving
%X Scenario-based Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) is an effective and realistic way in terms of vehicle automation capability identiﬁcation (e.g. SAE/NHTSA automation level). For autonomous driving where the system heavily interacts with its environment by means of sensor (fusion) and actuators, hazard consideration has to be expanded from E/E system malfunctioning behavior to also cover Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF) including cybersecurity. Scenario-based HARA can capture how to analyze hazards considering Functional Safety (FuSa) and SOTIF, but their relation and inter dependencies need to be represented in a systematic way. Moreover, powerful methods like System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) are used to identify, deﬁne, and analyze hazards but not risk assessments. Therefore, we investigate state-of-the-art on scenario-based HARA and propose an extended HARA that combines FuSa and SOTIF. In particular, we consider (a) functional scenario representation and selection of scenarios (e.g. drawing basic and accident scenarios in HARA) and (b) methods to ﬁnd the relation and interactions of FuSa and SOTIF at once for each HAD function. Moreover, we execute a scenario-based HARA method with extension by means of demonstrating the process in an applicable case i.e. a transverse guidance assist system and disclose outcome.

%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S095183202100315X
%X Due to the catastrophic impact of Fire and Explosion Accidents in Oil Depots (FEAOD), the prevention and control of such accidents is the most critical part of risk management. In this study, a Bow-tie (BT) model was built for FEAOD, while a quantitative risk assessment and consequence assessment was performed in conjunction with the risk matrix. Then, due to the uncertainty and ambiguity of the probability data of Basic Events (BEs) during the expert elicitation process, this study creatively proposed a Cloud-Analytic Hierarchy Process (CloudAHP) algorithm and Group Cloud Decision-Making (GCDM) algorithm based on the Fuzzy Cloud Membership Function (FCMF). Finally, combined with the probability estimation algorithm and the sensitivity analysis, a novel risk quantitative assessment algorithm for a BT model was developed based on Cloud Model (CM) theory. The discretion, ambiguity, and randomness were considered during the evaluation process, and a more scientific assessment fusion result of Decision makers (DMs) was obtained, while the Delphi iteration process further reduced personal errors. A case study of an oil depot in Dalian was investigated. The results showed that the proposed method more accurately identified the weak links in the safety system, providing a theoretical basis for the risk prevention and control.

%X RGB cameras are arguably one of the most relevant sensors for autonomous driving applications. It is undeniable that failures of vehicle cameras may compromise the autonomous driving task, possibly leading to unsafe behaviors when images that are subsequently processed by the driving system are altered. To support the definition of safe and robust vehicle architectures and intelligent systems, in this paper we define the failure modes of a vehicle camera, together with an analysis of effects and known mitigations. Further, we build a software library for the generation of the corresponding failed images and we feed them to the trained agent of an autonomous driving simulator: the misbehavior of the trained agent allows a better understanding of failures effects and especially of the resulting safety risk.

%X The operational design domain (ODD) of an automated driving system (ADS) can be used to confine the environmental scope of where the ADS is safe to execute. ODD acclimatization is one of the necessary steps for validating vehicle safety in complex traffic environments. This article proposes an approach and architectural design to extract and enhance the ODD of the ADS based on the task scenario and the corresponding requirements in the development and verification cycle. The ODD is tightly focused on a unified quantifiable environmental model in the proposed approach while overseeing the ODD extraction process by formal specifications. In addition to the acclimatization framework, an implementation of the proposed approach is examined with two learning-based agents to demonstrate its feasibility. The proof of concept has shown promising directions for future work on ODD monitoring and on the applications in iterative development for ADSs.

%X To allow a vehicle with highly automated driving functions to operate on the road the overall safety (safe functionalities, functional insufficiencies including cybersecurity) of the driving system must be guaranteed. Therefore, a generic Safety Management System (SMS), that includes all useful and necessary regulations should be applied. The given specifications regarding the safety of driving systems shall be understood and considered in order to define an acceptable SMS for the Highly Automated Driving Function (HADF). Derived from the generic SMS a specific management system has to be developed to guide the development and deployment of the HADF. The research presented in this paper investigates the currently available SMS in different sectors like aviation, marine, and railway to propose a new set of components and elements that are useful and modified for a HADF’s SMS. Moreover, the paper provides a systematic approach to how the new set of components and elements can be applied for a HADF SMS. Additionally, well established hazard identification methods (scenario-based HARA and STPA) are compared and integrated into the safety concept phase. The complexity of scenarios is unique for a HADF. Since the SMS is going to be complicated for automotive HADFs and a constantly developing process, methods for evaluation and continuous improvement are needed. This paper gives insight into the structure of the SMS and to guarantee its applicability the use of a helpful software tool is considered. Furthermore, the proposed SMS approach can be adjusted as a groundwork for research concerns like validation for homologation and assess the safety of a HADF.

%T DADA: Driver Attention Prediction in Driving Accident Scenarios
%V 23
%N 6
%P 4959-4971
%U https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9312486/
%X Driver attention prediction is becoming an essential research problem in human-like driving systems. This work makes an attempt to predict the driver attention in driving accident scenarios (DADA). However, challenges tread on the heels of that because of the dynamic trafﬁc scene, intricate and imbalanced accident categories. In this work, we design a semantic context induced attentive fusion network (SCAFNet). We ﬁrst segment the RGB video frames into the images with different semantic regions (i.e., semantic images), where each region denotes one semantic category of the scene (e.g., road, trees, etc.), and learn the spatio-temporal features of RGB frames and semantic images in two parallel paths simultaneously. Then, the learned features are fused by an attentive fusion network to ﬁnd the semantic-induced scene variation in driver attention prediction. The contributions are three folds. 1) With the semantic images, we introduce their semantic context features and verify the manifest promotion effect for helping the driver attention prediction, where the semantic context features are modeled by a graph convolution network (GCN) on semantic images; 2) We fuse the semantic context features of semantic images and the features of RGB frames in an attentive strategy, and the fused details are transferred over frames by a convolutional LSTM module to obtain the attention map of each video frame with the consideration of historical scene variation in driving situations; 3) The superiority of the proposed method is evaluated on our previously collected dataset (named as DADA-2000) and two other challenging datasets with state-of-the-art methods.

%X Challenges related to automated driving are no longer focused on just the construction of such automated vehicles (AVs) but also on assuring the safety of operation. Recent advances in Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving have motivated more extensive study in safety guarantees of complicated AV maneuvers, which aligns with the goal of ISO 21448 (Safety of the Intended Functions or SOTIF), i.e., minimizing unsafe scenarios both known and unknown, as well as Vision Zero – eliminating highway fatalities by 2050. A majority of approaches used in providing safety guarantees for AV motion control originate from formal methods, especially reachability analysis (RA), which relies on mathematical models for the dynamic evolution of the system to provide guarantees. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there have been no review papers dedicated to describing and interpreting state-ofthe-art of formal methods in the context of AVs. In this work, we provide both an overview of the safety veriﬁcation, validation, and certiﬁcation process, as well as a review of formal safety techniques that are best suited to AV applications. We also propose a uniﬁed scenario coverage framework that can provide either a formal or sample-based estimate of safety veriﬁcation for full AVs. Finally, challenges and future opportunities beyond the scope of current published research for assured AV safety are presented.

%T SOTIF Entropy: Online SOTIF Risk Quantification and Mitigation for Autonomous Driving
%P 1-17
%U https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285374/
%X Autonomous driving confronts great challenges in complex traffic scenarios, where the SOTIF risk can be triggered by the dynamic operational environment and system insufficiencies. The SOTIF risk is reflected not only intuitively in the collision risk with objects outside the autonomous vehicles, but also inherently in the performance limitation risk of the implemented algorithms. How to minimize the SOTIF risk for autonomous driving is currently a critical, difficult, and unresolved issue. Therefore, this paper proposes the “SelfSurveillance and Self-Adaption System” as a systematic approach to online minimize the SOTIF risk, which aims to provide a systematic solution for monitoring, quantification, and mitigation of inherent and external risks. As a demonstration of the system, the risk monitoring of the perception algorithm is highlighted. Moreover, the inherent perception algorithm risk and external collision risk are jointly quantified via SOTIF entropy, which is then propagated downstream to the decision-making module and mitigated. Finally, Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments are conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. The results demonstrate that the system enables dependable online monitoring, quantification, and mitigation of SOTIF risk in real-time critical traffic environments.

%T Finding Critical Scenarios for Automated Driving Systems: A Systematic Mapping Study
%V 49
%N 3
%P 991-1026
%U https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9763411/
%X Scenario-based approaches have been receiving a huge amount of attention in research and engineering of automated driving systems. Due to the complexity and uncertainty of the driving environment, and the complexity of the driving task itself, the number of possible driving scenarios that an Automated Driving System or Advanced Driving-Assistance System may encounter is virtually inﬁnite. Therefore it is essential to be able to reason about the identiﬁcation of scenarios and in particular critical ones that may impose unacceptable risk if not considered. Critical scenarios are particularly important to support design, veriﬁcation and validation efforts, and as a basis for a safety case. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic mapping study in the context of autonomous driving. The main contributions are: (i) introducing a comprehensive taxonomy for critical scenario identiﬁcation methods; (ii) giving an overview of the state-of-the-art research based on the taxonomy encompassing 86 papers between 2017 and 2020; and (iii) identifying open issues and directions for further research. The provided taxonomy comprises three main perspectives encompassing the problem deﬁnition (the why), the solution (the methods to derive scenarios), and the assessment of the established scenarios. In addition, we discuss open research issues considering the perspectives of coverage, practicability, and scenario space explosion.

%T Risk Management Core -- Towards an Explicit Representation of Risk in Automated Driving
%I arXiv
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07715
%X While current automotive safety standards provide implicit guidance on how unreasonable risk can be avoided, manufacturers are required to specify risk acceptance criteria for automated driving systems (SAE Level 3+). However, the ‘unreasonable’ level of risk of automated driving systems (SAE Level 3+) is not yet concisely deﬁned. Solely applying current safety standards to such novel systems could potentially not be sufﬁcient for their acceptance. As risk is managed with implicit knowledge about safety measures in existing automotive standards, an explicit alignment with risk acceptance criteria is challenging. Hence, we propose an approach for an explicit representation and management of risk, which we call the Risk Management Core. The proposal of this process framework is based on requirements elicited from current safety standards and apply the Risk Management Core to the task of specifying safe behavior for an automated driving system in an example scenario.

%T Combining precursor and Cloud Leaky noisy-OR logic gate Bayesian network for dynamic probability analysis of major accidents in the oil depots
%V 241
%P 109625
%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0951832023005392
%X Major accidents in oil depots are low-frequency/high-consequence events. Because of the relative scarcity of accident data, it is difficult to elucidate the dynamic characteristics of risks using conventional methods. Direct data on major accidents is scarce. Thus, relevant data on precursor accidents has attracted increased attention. Here, the Cloud Leaky Noisy-OR(CLNOR) logic gate is proposed to improve the traditional Bayesian network (BN), and a probabilistic analysis model is developed for the analysis of major accidents based on precursor data and Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis (HBA). The CLNOR logic gates extensively reduce the evaluation workload of the traditional noise-OR logic gate. Furthermore, the proposed approach overcomes the cognitive uncertainty introduced by expert elicitation. HBA based on precursor data extracts the dynamic character of risk and deals with the source-source uncertainty introduced by different data sources, thus improving the precision of fre­ quency estimation. The BN allows the dynamic analysis of probabilities and dynamic mining of key risk pre­ vention factors, overcoming the model uncertainty of traditional models. As updates based on new observations are performed, dynamic risk probability distributions are generated. A case study based on the proposed method was conducted, demonstrating that the method is effective for dynamic risk prediction and prevention.

%T Bayesian regression based condition monitoring approach for effective reliability prediction of random processes in autonomous energy supply operation
%V 201
%P 106966
%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0951832019312001
%X The probabilistic analysis on condition monitoring data has been widely established through the energy supply process to specify the optimum risk remediation program. In such studies, the fluctuations and uncertainties of the operational data including the variability between source of data and the correlation of observations, have to be incorporated if the efficiency is of importance. This study presents a novel probabilistic methodology based on observation data for signifying the impact of risk factors on safety indicators when consideration is given to uncertainty quantification. It provides designers, risk managers and operators a framework for risk mitigation planning within the energy supply processes, whilst also assessing the online reliability. These calculations address the involved and, most of the time, unconsidered risk to make a prediction of safety conditions of the operation in future. To this end, the generalized linear model (GLM) is applied to offer the explanatory model as a regression function for risk factors and safety indicators. Hierarchical Bayesian approach (HBA) is then inferred for the calculations of regression function including interpretation of the intercept and coefficient factors. With Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation from likelihood function and prior distribution, the HBA is capable of capturing the aforementioned fluctuations and uncertainties in the process of obtaining the posterior values of the intercept and coefficient factors. To illustrate the capabilities of the developed framework, an autonomous operation of Natural Gas Regulating and Metering Station in Italy has been considered as case study.

%V 72
%P 175-195
%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167404817301931
%X The introduction of connected systems and digital technology in process industries creates new cyber-security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by sophisticated threats and lead to undesirable safety accidents. Thus, identifying these vulnerabilities during risk analysis becomes an important part for effective industrial risk evaluation. However, nowadays, safety and security are analyzed separately when they should not be. This is because a security threat can lead to the same dangerous phenomenon as a safety incident. In this paper, a new method that considers safety and security together during industrial risk analysis is proposed. This approach combines bowtie analysis, commonly used for safety analysis, with a new extended version of attack tree analysis, introduced for security analysis of industrial control systems. The combined use of bowtie and attack tree provides an exhaustive representation of risk scenarios in terms of safety and security. We then propose an approach for evaluating the risk level based on two-term likelihood parts, one for safety and one for security. The application of this approach is demonstrated using the case study of a risk scenario in a chemical facility.

%T Software Engineering for Responsible AI: An Empirical Study and Operationalised Patterns
%P 241-242
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09478
%X Although artificial intelligence (AI) is solving real-world challenges and transforming industries, there are serious concerns about its ability to behave and make decisions in a responsible way. Many AI ethics principles and guidelines for responsible AI have been recently issued by governments, organisations, and enterprises. However, these AI ethics principles and guidelines are typically high-level and do not provide concrete guidance on how to design and develop responsible AI systems. To address this shortcoming, we first present an empirical study where we interviewed 21 scientists and engineers to understand the practitioners' perceptions on AI ethics principles and their implementation. We then propose a template that enables AI ethics principles to be operationalised in the form of concrete patterns and suggest a list of patterns using the newly created template. These patterns provide concrete, operationalised guidance that facilitate the development of responsible AI systems.

%X Although AI has significant potential to transform society, there are serious concerns about its ability to behave and make decisions responsibly. Many ethical regulations, principles, and guidelines for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, these principles are high-level and difficult to put into practice. In the meantime much effort has been put into responsible AI from the algorithm perspective, but they are limited to a small subset of ethical principles amenable to mathematical analysis. Responsible AI issues go beyond data and algorithms and are often at the system-level crosscutting many system components and the entire software engineering lifecycle. Based on the result of a systematic literature review, this paper identifies one missing element as the system-level guidance: how to design the architecture of responsible AI systems. We present a summary of design patterns that can be embedded into the AI systems as product features to contribute to responsible-AI-by-design.

Many ethical regulations, principles, and frameworks for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, they are high level and difficult to put into practice. On the other hand, most AI researchers focus on algorithmic solutions, while the responsible AI challenges actually crosscut the entire engineering lifecycle and components of AI systems. To close the gap in operationalizing responsible AI, this paper aims to develop a roadmap on software engineering for responsible AI. The roadmap focuses on (i) establishing multi-level governance for responsible AI systems, (ii) setting up the development processes incorporating process-oriented practices for responsible AI systems, and (iii) building responsible-AI-by-design into AI systems through system-level architectural style, patterns and techniques.

%T Evaluation Framework for Performance Limitation of Autonomous Systems under Sensor Attack
%I arXiv
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07118
%X Autonomous systems such as self-driving cars rely on sensors to perceive the surrounding world. Measures must be taken against attacks on sensors, which have been a hot topic in the last few years. For that goal one must ﬁrst evaluate how sensor attacks aﬀect the system, i.e. which part or whole of the system will fail if some of the built-in sensors are compromised, or will keep safe, etc. Among the relevant safety standards, ISO/PAS 21448 addresses the safety of road vehicles taking into account the performance limitations of sensors, but leaves security aspects out of scope. On the other hand, ISO/SAE 21434 addresses the security perspective during the development process of vehicular systems, but not speciﬁc threats such as sensor attacks. As a result the safety of autonomous systems under sensor attack is yet to be addressed. In this paper we propose a framework that combines safety analysis for scenario identiﬁcation, and scenario-based simulation with sensor attack models embedded. Given an autonomous system model, we identify hazard scenarios caused by sensor attacks, and evaluate the performance limitations in the scenarios. We report on a prototype simulator for autonomous vehicles with radar, cameras and LiDAR along with attack models against the sensors. Our experiments show that our framework can evaluate how the system safety changes as parameters of the attacks and the sensors vary.

%T Analyzing Real-world Accidents for Test Scenario Generation for Automated Vehicles
%P 288-295
%X Identification of test scenarios for Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) remains a key challenge for the Verification & Validation of ADSs. Various approaches including data based approaches and knowledge based approaches have been proposed for scenario generation. Identifying the conditions that lead to high severity traffic accidents can help us not only identify test scenarios for ADSs, but also implement measures to save lives and infrastructure resources. Taking a data based approach, in this paper, we introduce a novel accident data analysis method for generating test scenarios where we analyze UK's Stats19 accident data to identify trends in high severity accidents for test scenario generation. This paper first focuses on the severity of the accidents with the goal of relating it to static and time-dependent internal and external factors in a comprehensive way taking into account Operational Design Domain (ODD) properties, e.g. road, environmental conditions, and vehicle properties and driver characteristics. For this purpose, the paper utilizes a data grouping strategy (coarse-graining) and builds a logistic regression approach, derived from conventional regression models, in which emerging features become more pronounced, while uninteresting features and noise weaken. The approach makes the relationship between the factors and outcome variable more visible and hence well suited for the severity analysis. The method shows superior performance as compared to ordinary logistic models measured by goodness of fit and accounting for model variance $(R^2=0.05$ for the ordinary model, $R^2=0.85$ for the current model). The model is then used to solve the inverse problem of constructing high-risk pre-crash conditions as test scenarios for simulation based testing of ADSs.

%X Scenario-based testing is considered state-of-the-art to verify and validate Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. However, two essential unsolved challenges prevent the practical application of scenario-based testing according to the SOTIF-standard: (1) how to select a set of representative test scenarios, and (2) how to assess the effectiveness of a test scenario suite. In this paper, we leverage variability modelling techniques to select scenarios from a scenario space and assess the resulting scenario suites with a mutation score as metric. We capture the scenario space in a feature model and generate representative subsets with feature-interaction coverage sampling. The mutation score assesses the failure-finding effectiveness of these samples. We evaluate our concepts by sampling scenario suites for two independent Autonomous Emergency Braking function implementations and executing them on an industrialstrength simulator. Our results show that the feature model captures a scenario space that is relevant to identify all mutants. We show that sampling based on interaction coverage reduces the testing effort significantly while maintaining effectiveness in terms of mutation scores. Our results underline the potential of feature model sampling for testing in the automotive industry.

%X Simulations are commonly used to validate the design of autonomous systems. However, as these systems are increasingly deployed into safety-critical environments with aleatoric uncertainties, and with the increase in components that employ machine learning algorithms with epistemic uncertainties, validation methods which consider uncertainties are lacking. We present an approach that evaluates signal propagation in logical system architectures, in particular environment perception-chains, focusing on eﬀects of uncertainty to determine functional limitations. The perception based autonomous driving systems are represented by connected elements to constitute a certain functionality. The elements are based on (meta-)models to describe technical components and their behavior. The surrounding environment, in which the system is deployed, is modeled by parameters that are derived from a quasi-static scene. All parameter variations completely deﬁne input-states for the designed perception architecture. The input-states are treated as random variables inside the model of components to simulate aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty. The dissimilarity between the model-input and -output serves as measure for total uncertainty present in the system. The uncertainties are propagated through consecutive components and calculated by the same manner. The ﬁnal result consists of input-states which model uncertainty eﬀects for the speciﬁed functionality and therefore highlight shortcomings of the designed architecture.

%X With recent eﬀorts to make vehicles intelligent, solutions based on machine learning have been accepted to the ecosystem. These systems in the automotive domain are growing fast, speeding up the promising future of highly and fully automated driving, and respectively, raising new challenges regarding safety assurance approaches. Uncertainty in data and the machine learning methods is a key point to investigate one of the main origins of safety-related concerns. In this work, we inspect this issue in the domain of autonomous driving with an emphasis on four safety-related cases, then introduce our proposals to address the challenges and mitigate them. The core of our approach is on introducing monitoring limiters during development time of such intelligent systems.

%T Addressing the IEEE AV Test Challenge with Scenic and VerifAI
%P 136-142
%X This paper summarizes our formal approach to testing autonomous vehicles (AVs) in simulation for the IEEE AV Test Challenge. We demonstrate a systematic testing framework leveraging our previous work on formally-driven simulation for intelligent cyber-physical systems. First, to model and generate interactive scenarios involving multiple agents, we used Scenic, a probabilistic programming language for specifying scenarios. A Scenic program defines an abstract scenario as a distribution over configurations of physical objects and their behaviors over time. Sampling from an abstract scenario yields many different concrete scenarios which can be run as test cases for the AV. Starting from a Scenic program encoding an abstract driving scenario, we can use the Verifai toolkit to search within the scenario for failure cases with respect to multiple AV evaluation metrics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our testing framework by identifying concrete failure scenarios for an open-source autopilot, Apollo, starting from a variety of realistic traffic scenarios.

%P 1-8
%X We present a new approach to automated scenario-based testing of the safety of autonomous vehicles, especially those using advanced artificial intelligence-based components, spanning both simulation-based evaluation as well as testing in the real world. Our approach is based on formal methods, combining formal specification of scenarios and safety properties, algorithmic test case generation using formal simulation, test case selection for track testing, executing test cases on the track, and analyzing the resulting data. Experiments with a real autonomous vehicle at an industrial testing facility support our hypotheses that (i) formal simulation can be effective at identifying test cases to run on the track, and (ii) the gap between simulated and real worlds can be systematically evaluated and bridged.

%T A Survey on Safety-Critical Driving Scenario Generation -- A Methodological Perspective
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02215
%X Autonomous driving systems have witnessed a significant development during the past years thanks to the advance in machine learning-enabled sensing and decision-making algorithms. One critical challenge for their massive deployment in the real world is their safety evaluation. Most existing driving systems are still trained and evaluated on naturalistic scenarios collected from daily life or heuristically-generated adversarial ones. However, the large population of cars, in general, leads to an extremely low collision rate, indicating that the safety-critical scenarios are rare in the collected real-world data. Thus, methods to artificially generate scenarios become crucial to measure the risk and reduce the cost. In this survey, we focus on the algorithms of safety-critical scenario generation in autonomous driving. We first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of existing algorithms by dividing them into three categories: data-driven generation, adversarial generation, and knowledge-based generation. Then, we discuss useful tools for scenario generation, including simulation platforms and packages. Finally, we extend our discussion to five main challenges of current works -- fidelity, efficiency, diversity, transferability, controllability -- and research opportunities lighted up by these challenges.

%X Autonomous driving has become an important research area for road traﬃc, whereas testing of autonomous driving systems to ensure a safe and reliable operation, remains an open challenge. Substantial real-world testing or massive driving data collection does not scale, as the potential test scenarios in real-world traﬃc are inﬁnite and covering large shares of them in test is impractical, thus critical ones have to be prioritized. In this study, we establish a systematic approach for critical test scenario identiﬁcation with integrated tools and a workﬂow, to explore the most critical test scenarios and facilitate testing of the autonomous driving functions. We also demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our approach by using two real autonomous driving systems from the industry by collaborating with Volvo Cars. Our main contribution in this work is a feasible and complete tool-chain for critical test scenario identiﬁcation that is general for testing diﬀerent autonomous driving systems.

%X An autonomous vehicle (AV) is a combination of subsystems, measuring its driving environments with different sensors (e.g., camera, RADAR, and LiDAR) in real time. AVs follow their control policies and make real-time control decisions based on sensor measurements to ensure driving safety. Control policies in an AV are usually implemented with codes and not open to the public and drivers, which results in people’s strong concerns about driving safety. In this article, we propose a data-driven control policy-based driving safety analysis system (PoSa) to analyze the driving safety of a target AV. In PoSa, we ﬁrst build a data-driven control policy extraction method to extract control policies of a target AV based on its historical driving data. Then, we develop a hazard driving scenario identiﬁcation method to identify possible hazard driving scenarios of a target AV by executing the extracted control policies under different driving scenarios. Finally, we use vehicle driving data from one industry-standard AV platform (Baidu Apollo) to evaluate PoSa’s hazard driving scenario identiﬁcation performance. We compared its identiﬁcation results with Baidu AV accident reports from California DMV and the hazard driving scenario identiﬁcation results cover as many as 89% hazard driving scenarios in the Baidu AV accident report, which demonstrates that PoSa has good performance on identifying hazard driving scenarios and its identiﬁcation results can be used to optimize control policies for driving safety improvement.

%X Complex, dynamic, and interactive environment brings huge challenges to autonomous driving technologies. Because of the strong interactions between different traffic participants, autonomous vehicles (AVs) must learn how to interact with other road users. Failure to consider interaction when making decisions may result in safety issues. In this article, an interactionaware decision-making approach is proposed for AVs. First, focusing on the interaction at uncontrolled midblock crosswalks, the game theory is used to model the vehicle–pedestrian interaction (VPI). Then, an interaction inference framework is developed using the interaction model to obtain interaction information with pedestrians. Besides, a collaborative action planning method is proposed to generate collaborative actions. More importantly, interactive decision-making is formulated as an optimization problem by considering the task item and action item. Furthermore, considering pedestrians’ different levels of cooperation, the social force pedestrian model is developed. Then, a highly interactive environment is constructed. Finally, qualitative and quantitative evaluations are carried out against three baseline methods. The result shows that our method can interact with different pedestrians and balance safety and efficiency compared to baseline methods.

%X A connected and automated vehicle safety metric determines the performance of a subject vehicle (SV) by analyzing the data involving the interactions among the SV and other dynamic road users and environmental features. When the data set contains only a ﬁnite set of samples collected from the naturalistic mixed multi-modal trafﬁc driving environment, a metric is expected to generalize the safety assessment outcome from the observed ﬁnite samples to the unobserved cases by specifying in what domain the SV is expected to be safe and how safe the SV is, statistically, in that domain. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing safety metrics is able to justify the above properties with an operational domain speciﬁc, guaranteed complete, and provably unbiased safety evaluation outcome. In this paper, we propose a novel safety metric that involves the α-shape and the  -almost robustly forward invariant set to characterize the SV’s almost safe operable domain and the probability for the SV to remain inside the safe domain indeﬁnitely, respectively. The empirical performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in several different operational design domains through a series of cases covering a variety of ﬁdelity levels (real-world and simulators), driving environments (highway, urban, and intersections), road users (car, truck, and pedestrian), and SV driving behaviors (human driver and self driving algorithms).

%X To improve the safety, comfort, and efﬁciency of the intelligent transportation system, particularly in complex trafﬁc environments where autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs) coexist, a game theoretic trajectory planning framework is proposed in this article. Firstly, the game framework including non-cooperative games between AVs and HVs, as well as partial cooperative games between ego AV and other AVs is constructed. Secondly, a longitudinal game strategy for HVs is established with consideration of the driver’s longitudinal handling characteristics and personalized aggressiveness, with which the driving behaviors of HVs can be accurately predicted. Thirdly, the longitudinal game strategies for AVs at different positions are designed, with consideration of the safety constraints of AVs and surrounding vehicles, as well as the objectives of comfort and trafﬁc efﬁciency. Then, the interactive games of ego AV, HVs, and other AVs in different types of mixed-driving environments are solved based on the Stackelberg game and partial cooperative game methods. Finally, the optimal lane-changing (LC) gaps and longitudinal speed trajectories of AVs are obtained. Human-in-the-loop experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning framework in lane-changing scenarios involving HVs with different aggressiveness and response delays.

%X Monitoring driver behavior and recognizing driver actions is a crucial task in modern semi-autonomous driving conditions, where secondary activities, irrelevant to driving, should be minimized. The driver activity recognition problem represents a subclass of the widely studied action recognition task, but poses additional challenges stemming from the environment, the appearance of the participants, and the limited data availability for this specific task. Furthermore, the similarity of body movements and the nuanced changes when performing different actions further complicate the classification process. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of Temporal Segment Networks (TSNs) on the driver activity recognition task. Moreover, we propose a model to enhance the performance of such networks through the integration of information from pose landmarks, allowing for multi-modal fusion either in the early or late stages of the model, providing informed predictions for input videos. Thus, the simplicity of the TSN models is counterbalanced by the incorporation of prior knowledge, resulting in a fused model that outperforms more resource-demanding 3D architectures. The proposed method is evaluated on the Drive&Act dataset and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous works by a margin of 8.01% using only RGB video as input.

%T The effects of implementing human valence into the behavioral model of a fully autonomous vehicle
%V 98
%P 226-242
%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369847823001936
%X Objective: To test in two experiments whether people would be more willing to use a Level-5 Fully Autonomous Vehicle (FAV) if the FAV’s driving model is enhanced with human valence.
Background: Although it is believed that FAVs will eventually replace manual vehicles, people at present worry about the safety of FAVs, sense discomfort about FAVs, and it is doubtful whether they would be willing to use FAVs. Human valence is the degree to which someone is drawn towards or repulsed away from an object. However, the literature lacks empirical support on whether enhancing FAVs with valence could help ease concerns about safety, discomfort, and willingness to use FAVs.
Method: In Experiment I, conducted to address this void, participants manually drove in a driving simulator a simulated route at either 50 or 100 km/h and overtook road objects that traveled at either 0 or 50 km/h. Three proxy measures were recorded to infer human valence toward the overtaken objects: time-to-collision, lateral clearance, and perceived risk. The inferred valence was then implemented into Experiment II’s driving model of a FAV that different participants drove.
Results: Participants were most willing to re-use a Safe driving style. However, the enhanced FAV’s willingness was not significantly different from the Safe driving style.
Conclusion: The first empirical evidence about enhancing the driving model of FAVs with human valence motivates further research. Application: FAV manufacturers are advised to include human valence in the driving model of FAVs to increase people’s willingness to use them.

%X Vehicle trajectory prediction is essential in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), as it enables highly efficient collision avoidance, path planning, and traffic control. However, existing models for vehicle trajectory prediction predominantly focus on limited driving scenarios, resulting in limited applicability. To address this limitation, we present a novel vehicle trajectory prediction approach that employs a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, incorporating simulated environments and vehicle dynamic time series data, including longitudinal, vertical, and latitudinal position and acceleration. Our approach is distinguished by its ability to handle diverse urban driving scenarios, such as highways, roundabouts, intersections, and turns, which enhances its applicability and generalizability. We experimented and collected vehicle data from 17 drivers using a stationary driving simulator and the Euro Truck Simulator software. For the model implementation and validation, we utilized Python 3.9 and Google Colab, as well as the Scikit-learn library for Deep learning algorithms. The proposed CNN-LSTM model leverages a convolutional layer to learn local patterns and an LSTM layer to capture long-term temporal dependencies, improving performance in predicting vehicle trajectories. The experimental results demonstrate that the CNN-LSTM model provides more accurate predictions for longitudinal and lateral positions compared to traditional vehicle trajectory prediction methods that employ LSTM and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This research contributes to developing robust and reliable vehicle trajectory prediction systems vital for ADAS and AVs' safe and efficient operation. The proposed approach broadens the applicability of trajectory prediction models, enabling better-informed decision-making in various driving conditions and ultimately improving road safety and efficiency in the rapidly evolving field of autonomous transportation.

%X As autonomous driving technologies develop, biometrics technology using driver’s bio-signals provides various driver-customized infotainment services. Many studies on driver identiﬁcation are underway to improve the feature extraction and classiﬁcation steps to identify drivers with high accuracy. The existing identiﬁcation systems have used a driver’s single biological signal to identify the driver without considering the driver’s driving state. The identiﬁcation error rate was high because electromyography (EMG) is included according to motion artifacts while driving in the electrocardiogram (ECG) acquired by the driver’s behavioral characteristics. In this letter, EMG acquired by the driver’s motion and ECG acquired by the behavioral characteristics are used simultaneously to improve the identiﬁcation accuracy. The proposed identiﬁcation system converts ECG and EMG into 2D constant Q transform (CQT) images and classiﬁes drivers by multistream convolutional neural network (CNN). Our extensive experiments show that a single ECG can achieve 98.1% of the identiﬁcation accuracy, a single EMG can achieve 84.4% of the identiﬁcation accuracy, and a multisignal can achieve 98.9% of the identiﬁcation accuracy with 2D CQT.

%X Driver identiﬁcation has shown sustainable development in recent years in a wide variety of applications including but not limited to security, personalization, ﬂeet management, insurance telematics, or ride-hailing. However, the current progress suffers from several challenges such as costly data collections and the need for a huge amount of data from each individual for both driver identiﬁcation and impostor detection. Therefore, more novel and efﬁcient solutions are required to mitigate the existing challenges. In this paper, we address driver identiﬁcation and impostor detection tasks using driving behavior analysis of the drivers. We design a deep learning-based system architecture that analyzes windows of 30 seconds of driving data to capture the unique underlying characteristics of the individuals steering behavior based on which it further distinguishes the drivers. We also develop a novel strategy to tackle driver veriﬁcation and impostor detection tasks based on the combination of the proposed system architecture and Siamese networks concepts. We map the steering behavior of the drivers into latent representations which can be later used to train a similarity function. The performance of the proposed systems is tested over a real-world dataset of 95 drivers. The evaluation results indicate that our system outperforms well-established benchmarks and baseline methodologies.

%X Driver Fingerprinting (DF), reﬂecting unique driving characteristics, has received extensive attention for its prominent applications in various domains such as driver identiﬁcation in automobile sharing paradigms, driver-based insurance, and vehicle anti-theft. Previous research has primarily concentrated on utilizing data from sober states to establish DF models while rarely considering driving fatigue, a common and risky driving state. This study proposes a scheme to analyze the effects of fatigue on DF identiﬁcation and emphasizes the necessity of incorporating fatigue in DF models. Firstly, we conducted simulated driving experiments to collect the drivers’ behavior data, facial videos, and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Secondly, we calculated DF indicators using a double-layer sliding time window and used the Kruskal-Wallis test to extract the DF features. Finally, we divided the full sample set into three subsets: a sober sample subset, a fatigue sample subset, and a double state sample subset containing both sober and fatigue data. We used each sample subset to train DF models based on principal component analysis and long short-term memory. We then utilized all three sample subsets to evaluate the DF models trained by each subset. Combined with the correlation between the indicators and KSS, we analyzed the inﬂuence of fatigue on DF identiﬁcation. The results indicated that the identiﬁcation accuracies of DF models built solely on sober data signiﬁcantly decreased when applied to fatigue data. The average accuracy of the 7-driver groups showed the most substantial reduction of 54.59%. Conversely, DF models considering fatigue demonstrated a notable increase in the identiﬁcation accuracy of drivers, and the maximum increase of 25.47% was from the 7-driver groups. Additionally, we discussed the effects of time windows and the number of drivers on DF identiﬁcation accuracy and an application framework for driver identiﬁcation systems based on DF integrating driving fatigue detection.

%X Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will inevitably coexist on roads in the future, creating mixed-ﬂow trafﬁc. The heterogeneous carfollowing (CF) behavior of HDVs can degrade the control performance of CAVs and introduce inefﬁciencies in CAV operations. To address these challenges, it is necessary to comprehend HDV CF behavior in mixed-ﬂow trafﬁc. This driving simulator-based study investigates HDV CF behavior in mixed-ﬂow trafﬁc under three different CAV control settings (string-stable, string-unstable, and HDV-like). The effects of trafﬁc congestion level and demographic characteristics on CF behavior are also considered. Statistical analysis and CF model calibration, based on trajectory data collected from 72 participants in driving simulator experiments, are performed to examine the impacts of these factors on string stability, trafﬁc efﬁciency, and safety. Then, online parameter estimation is conducted to illustrate the time-varying desired time headway, and sensitivity to spacing and speed variations (i.e., CF behavior evolution). Additionally, analysis of post-experiment interview results and eye-tracking data show that the string-stable CAV control setting is preferred by most HDV drivers, but can trigger driver distraction. The results also provide insights for CF behavior prediction and the optimal mixed platoon formation to enhance CAV beneﬁts for trafﬁc ﬂow.

%X The first exposure most people will have to fully automated vehicles will be Low-speed Automated Vehicles (LSAVs) on select corridors. LSAVs may disrupt traffic due to their slower speeds and experience increased risky overtaking by nearby drivers which could decrease safety for their occupants and surrounding road users. A field observational study compared driver behavior near an LSAV and a human-driven research vehicle across 94 passes of a 1.3-mile urban downtown route (4 straight and 4 right-turn sections). GEE analyses indicated a higher likelihood of other drivers queuing behind the LSAV when stopped, overtaking the LSAV while turning at signalized intersections, and overtaking the LSAV along straight road segments. To test whether the low speed of the LSAV was the key factor for this difference, 85 participants in a second study watched videos from the perspective of a driver following a simulated LSAV and a simulated passenger vehicle traveling at either low speeds (16 km/h) or high speeds (40 km/h). Once the simulated vehicle stopped midblock at a marked crosswalk, the participants responded whether they would, as a driver, attempt to pass the stopped vehicle. GEE analyses indicated participants were more willing to pass the vehicle if it had been portrayed as driving at a slower speed, irrespective of vehicle type. These results indicate a disruptive effect of LSAVs in mixed traffic and a need to investigate alternative communication signal designs for LSAVs, along with policy changes to mitigate these risks such as regulations on LSAV speeds and traffic separation.

%T Improving safety in mixed traffic: A learning-based model predictive control for autonomous and human-driven vehicle platooning
%V 293
%P 111673
%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0950705124003083
%X As autonomous vehicles (AVs) become more common on public roads, their interaction with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in mixed traffic is inevitable. This requires new control strategies for AVs to handle the unpredictable nature of HVs. This study focused on safe control in mixed-vehicle platoons consisting of both AVs and HVs, particularly during longitudinal car-following scenarios. We introduce a novel model that combines a conventional first-principles model with a Gaussian process (GP) machine learning-based model to better predict HV behavior. Our results showed a significant improvement in predicting HV speed, with a 35.64% reduction in the root mean square error compared with the use of the first-principles model alone. We developed a new control strategy called GP-MPC, which uses the proposed HV model for safer distance management between vehicles in the mixed platoon. The GP-MPC strategy effectively utilizes the capacity of the GP model to assess uncertainties, thereby significantly enhancing safety in challenging traffic scenarios, such as emergency braking scenarios. In simulations, the GP-MPC strategy outperformed the baseline MPC method, offering better safety and more efficient vehicle movement in mixed traffic.

%T Modeling mixed traffic flows of human-driving vehicles and connected and autonomous vehicles considering human drivers’ cognitive characteristics and driving behavior interaction
%V 609
%P 128368
%U https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378437122009268
%X Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are developing rapidly nowadays. In the near future, we may see human-driving vehicles (HVs) and CAVs running on the same road. The characteristics of human drivers and the interaction between HVs and CAVs, therefore, need to be further studied. All these factors will have a great impact on traffic operation. This paper aims to explore a modeling method to analyze the operation mechanism of mixed traffic flows of HVs and CAVs. Considering HV drivers’ cognitive behavioral characteristics and HV–CAV interaction effects, the forward and lateral movement rules of HVs and CAVs are proposed based on the Cellular Automata model. Then the fundamental diagram, congestion degree, lane-changing frequency, and time-spatial diagram are obtained by numerical simulation. The results show that the presence of CAVs is positively related to macroscopic traffic parameters, including velocity, flow and critical density. CAVs help to relieve traffic congestion and instabilities. The congestion degree of pure CAV traffic flow is about 1/3 that of pure HV traffic flow. When the CAV penetration rate is relatively low, the interaction between HV and CAV has a significant impact on traffic operation. Specifically, when the CAV penetration rate is below 0.5∼0.6, increasing the CAV penetration rate will increase the lane-changing frequency of the whole traffic flow.

%T Beyond accidents and misuse: Decoding the structural risk dynamics of artificial intelligence
%X The integration of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) across contemporary sectors and industries is not just a technological upgrade but a transformation with profound implications. This paper explores the concept of structural risks associated with the rapid integration of advanced AI across social, economic, and political systems. This framework challenges conventional perspectives that primarily focus on direct AI threats such as accidents and misuse and suggests that these more proximate risks are interconnected and influenced by a larger sociotechnical system. By analyzing the complex interactions between technological advancements and social dynamics, this study identifies three primary categories of structural risks: antecedent structural causes, antecedent AI system causes, and deleterious feedback loops. We present a comprehensive framework to understand the causal chains that drive these risks, highlighting the interdependence between societal-scale structural forces and the more proximate risks of misuse, system failures, and the diffusion of misaligned systems. The paper articulates how unchecked AI advancement can reshape power dynamics, trust, and incentive structures, leading to profound and often unpredictable societal shifts. We introduce a methodological research agenda for mapping, simulating, and gaming these dynamics aimed at preparing policymakers and national security professionals for the challenges posed by next-generation AI technologies. The paper concludes with policy recommendations to mitigate these risks by incorporating a nuanced understanding of the AI–sociotechnical nexus into strategic planning and international governance.

%X The development of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) has created a novel job, the safety driver, recruited from experienced drivers to supervise and operate AV in numerous driving missions. Safety drivers usually work with non-perfect AV in high-risk real-world trafc environments for road testing tasks. However, this group of workers is under-explored in the HCI community. To fll this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 safety drivers. Our results present how safety drivers cope with defective algorithms and shape and calibrate their perceptions while working with AV. We found that, as front-line workers, safety drivers are forced to take risks accumulated from the AV industry upstream and are also confronting restricted self-development in working for AV development. We contribute the frst empirical evidence of the lived experience of safety drivers, the frst passengers in the development of AV, and also the grassroots workers for AV, which can shed light on future human-AI interaction research.

%X In the domain of autonomous driving, the ofﬂine Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches exhibit notable efﬁcacy in addressing sequential decision-making problems from ofﬂine datasets. However, maintaining safety in diverse safety-critical scenarios remains a signiﬁcant challenge due to long-tailed and unforeseen scenarios absent from ofﬂine datasets. In this letter, we introduce the saFety-aware strUctured Scenario representatION (FUSION), a pioneering representation learning method in ofﬂine RL to facilitate the learning of a generalizable end-to-end driving policy by leveraging structured scenario information. FUSION capitalizes on the causal relationships between the decomposed reward, cost, state, and action space, constructing a framework for structured sequential reasoning in dynamic trafﬁc environments. We conduct extensive evaluations in two typical real-world settings of the distribution shift in autonomous vehicles, demonstrating the good balance between safety cost and utility reward compared to the current state-of-the-art safe RL and IL baselines. Empirical evidence in various driving scenarios attests that FUSION signiﬁcantly enhances the safety and generalizability of autonomous driving agents, even in the face of challenging and unseen environments. Furthermore, our ablation studies reveal noticeable improvements in the integration of causal representation into the ofﬂine safe RL algorithm. Our code implementation is available on the project website.

%X The rapid progress of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has brought the prospect of a driverless future closer than ever. Recent fatalities, however, have emphasized the importance of safety validation through large-scale testing. Multiple approaches achieve this fully automatically using high-fidelity simulators, i.e., by generating diverse driving scenarios and evaluating autonomous driving systems (ADSs) against different test oracles. While effective at finding violations, these approaches do not identify the decisions and actions that caused them—information that is critical for improving the safety of ADSs. To address this challenge, we propose ACAV, an automated framework designed to conduct causality analyses for AV accident recordings in two stages. First, we apply feature extraction schemas based on the messages exchanged between ADS modules, and use a weighted voting method to discard frames of the recording unrelated to the accident. Second, we use safety specifications to identify safety-critical frames and deduce causal events by applying CAT—our causal analysis tool—to a station-time graph. We evaluated ACAV on the Apollo ADS, finding that it can identify five distinct types of causal events in 93.64% of 110 accident recordings generated by an AV testing engine. We further evaluated ACAV on 1206 accident recordings collected from versions of Apollo injected with specific faults, finding that it can correctly identify causal events in 96.44% of the accidents triggered by prediction errors, and 85.73% of the accidents triggered by planning errors.

%T Exploring the causality of end-to-end autonomous driving
%I arXiv
%U http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06546
%X Deep learning-based models are widely deployed in autonomous driving areas, especially the increasingly noticed end-to-end solutions. However, the black-box property of these models raises concerns about their trustworthiness and safety for autonomous driving, and how to debug the causality has become a pressing concern. Despite some existing research on the explainability of autonomous driving, there is currently no systematic solution to help researchers debug and identify the key factors that lead to the final predicted action of end-to-end autonomous driving. In this work, we propose a comprehensive approach to explore and analyze the causality of end-to-end autonomous driving. First, we validate the essential information that the final planning depends on by using controlled variables and counterfactual interventions for qualitative analysis. Then, we quantitatively assess the factors influencing model decisions by visualizing and statistically analyzing the response of key model inputs. Finally, based on the comprehensive study of the multi-factorial end-to-end autonomous driving system, we have developed a strong baseline and a tool for exploring causality in the close-loop simulator CARLA. It leverages the essential input sources to obtain a well-designed model, resulting in highly competitive capabilities. As far as we know, our work is the first to unveil the mystery of end-to-end autonomous driving and turn the black box into a white one. Thorough close-loop experiments demonstrate that our method can be applied to end-to-end autonomous driving solutions for causality debugging.

%X The trustworthiness of robots and autonomous systems (RASs) has taken a prominent position on the way toward full autonomy. This work is the ﬁrst to systematically explore the key facets of human-centered AI (HAI) for trustworthy RAS (TRAS). We identiﬁed ﬁve key properties of a TRAS, i.e., RAS must be: 1) safe in any uncertain and dynamic environment; 2) secure, i.e., protect itself from cyber threats; 3) healthy and fault tolerant; 4) trusted and easy to use to enable effective human–machine interaction (HMI); and 5) compliant with the law and ethical expectations. While the applications of RAS have mainly focused on performance and productivity, not enough scientiﬁc attention has been paid to the risks posed by advanced artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) in RAS. We analytically examine the challenges of implementing TRAS with respect to the ﬁve key properties and explore the role and roadmap of AI technologies in ensuring the trustworthiness of RAS in respect of safety, security, health, HMI, and ethics. A new acceptance model of RAS is provided as a framework for HAI requirements and for implementing TRAS by design. This approach promotes humanlevel intelligence to augment human capabilities and focuses on contribution to humanity.

%T Assessing unknown hazards for SOTIF based on twin scenarios empowered autonomous driving

%* https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/downloads/license-information/IEEE.html
%U https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587202/
%X Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) is paramount in autonomous driving, particularly at and beyond Level 3. An essential aspect of SOTIF research involves constructing and accurately assessing a broad range of hazardous scenarios. The current research landscape presents challenges in extensively testing autonomous vehicles and identifying all unknown triggering events within their intended functionalities. Filling this gap, this paper introduces a new methodology, Noisy-HBN, driven by four-layer factors aggregated through the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which integrates the Bayesian network with Noisy nodes to assess the impact of unknown causes on SOTIF. To appraise the efficacy of this model, a new virtual dataset, DADA-Plus, was developed, an extension of the opensource DADA dataset, created using the twin scenario generation algorithm. The scenario-based verification underscores that the Noisy-HBN model is adept at estimating the influence of unknown factors. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis reveals that the known factors identified significantly correlate with the occurrence of accidents. Comparative analysis results show that the risk assessment coverage of Noisy-HBN has reached the stateof-the-art (SOTA) level.
