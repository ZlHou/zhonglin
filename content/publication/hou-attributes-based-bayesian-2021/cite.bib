 abstract = {Safety of the intended functionality is an indispensable safe condition that must be considered for autonomous driving on the road. The key to study SOTIF is to construct as many hazardous scenarios as possible and accurately assess SOTIF. It is difficult to test many automated driving vehicles in the current research and discover all the unknown triggering events in the intended functionality. As a new simulation method, vehicle digital twins can simulate as many driving scenarios as possible efficiently and at a low cost in a short time. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm to assess SOTIF with unknown hazards based on the vehicle digital twins based on a Bayesian hazard graph with attributes and Noisy-OR structures. This paper uses CARLA to build the vehicle digital twins and testing this algorithm based on these digital twins. After testing, the SOTIF quantitative assessment algorithm proposed in this paper is effective and has good performance.},
