abstract: Detecting and understanding driver behaviors in automated vehicles are critical
  for reducing the risk of misuse and ensuring the Safety Of The Intended Functionality
  (SOTIF). Using a Temporal Recurrent Network (TRN), the paper proposes the driver-TRN
  model to detect and predict driver behaviors based on real-time vehicular data,
  such as in-car video, road camera, and sensor data, which addresses intended risks
  resulting from the interaction between drivers and automated systems that may be
  overlooked. This paper improves the performance of the driver-TRN with multiple
  data sources and multi-task loss finetuning. The experiments based on the Brain4Cars
  dataset show that the driver-TRN can enhance the safety and reliability of automated
  vehicles by providing a more comprehensive detection of driver behaviors.
