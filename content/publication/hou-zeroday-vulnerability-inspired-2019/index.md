abstract: Safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) is expected to be the third
  type of road vehicle auto-driving safety in addition to information security and
  functional safety. SOTIF which is unknown and uncertain is caused by non-system
  failure or personnel misoperation. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that
  SOTIF cannot be accepted will be dangerous. The unknown triggering events triggered
  suddenly or exploited by a malicious hacker will pose a threat to vehicle safety.
  In the field of traditional network security, there have been many pieces of research
  on vulnerability assessment. This paper establishes hazard graph for SOTIF and triggering
  event models and proposes a safety assessment method for unknown triggering events
  of SOTIF and a method to enhances SOTIF inspired by the zero-day vulnerability assessment
  in the traditional cybersecurity field. The AEB system is used as an example to
  apply the proposed algorithm, and Petri net accessibility testing is used as a verification
  of the correctness of the algorithm in this paper.
