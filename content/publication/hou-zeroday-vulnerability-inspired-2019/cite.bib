 abstract = {Safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) is expected to be the third type of road vehicle auto-driving safety in addition to information security and functional safety. SOTIF which is unknown and uncertain is caused by non-system failure or personnel misoperation. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that SOTIF cannot be accepted will be dangerous. The unknown triggering events triggered suddenly or exploited by a malicious hacker will pose a threat to vehicle safety. In the field of traditional network security, there have been many pieces of research on vulnerability assessment. This paper establishes hazard graph for SOTIF and triggering event models and proposes a safety assessment method for unknown triggering events of SOTIF and a method to enhances SOTIF inspired by the zero-day vulnerability assessment in the traditional cybersecurity field. The AEB system is used as an example to apply the proposed algorithm, and Petri net accessibility testing is used as a verification of the correctness of the algorithm in this paper.},
