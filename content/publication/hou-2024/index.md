abstract: Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) is paramount in autonomous
  driving, particularly at and beyond Level 3. An essential aspect of SOTIF research
  involves constructing and accurately assessing a broad range of hazardous scenarios.
  The current research landscape presents challenges in extensively testing autonomous
  vehicles and identifying all unknown triggering events within their intended functionalities.
  Filling this gap, this paper introduces a new methodology, Noisy-HBN, driven by
  four-layer factors aggregated through the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which integrates
  the Bayesian network with Noisy nodes to assess the impact of unknown causes on
  SOTIF. To appraise the efficacy of this model, a new virtual dataset, DADA-Plus,
  was developed, an extension of the opensource DADA dataset, created using the twin
  scenario generation algorithm. The scenario-based verification underscores that
  the Noisy-HBN model is adept at estimating the influence of unknown factors. Furthermore,
  the sensitivity analysis reveals that the known factors identified significantly
  correlate with the occurrence of accidents. Comparative analysis results show that
  the risk assessment coverage of Noisy-HBN has reached the stateof-the-art (SOTA)
  level.
