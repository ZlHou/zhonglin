abstract: The scenario-based tests have been an important means of improving the safety
  and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Moreover, ensuring the fidelity of
  generated scenarios is a safeguard for scenario-based tests. This article presents
  a new approach to generate twin scenarios for the virtual testing of AVs using meta
  scenarios. By extracting key parameter clusters from real-world scenarios and redefining
  and reassembling them, a large number of twin scenarios are generated. This approach
  addresses the need for diverse scenarios in AV virtual testing and enhances efficiency
  and hazard detection in the Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) assessment.
  The validity of twin scenarios, their temporal logic, and social attributes are
  verified using the UPPAAL tool, ensuring reliability and fidelity in virtual testing
  with AV digital twins. This innovative method offers a valuable solution to address
  challenges in AV virtual testing and improve the overall assessment process.
